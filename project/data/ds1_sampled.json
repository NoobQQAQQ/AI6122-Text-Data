This prevents lost of any potency.I follow ABC bodybuilding's article on the Window of Opportunity.Everyone should read this article and use this formula. This is the best guideline on essential supplementation.Please keep in mind that it is a guide, not a dogma. Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months. My bench went from 215 pounds to 450, body fat from 7% to 3%, and mile time from 6 minutes to 5. It works.Here are the quick basics, although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out, you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking, or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine, 5-10 grams of glutamine, and a multi-anti-oxidant formula. All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital:Step One:Blend 1/3 protein (experiment to find the exact number for you), 1/3 dextrose (simple sugar), and 1/3 maltodextrin (complex sugar) with enough water (water should be at least 92% of the total mixture). Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.Shake the ingredients well. Put creatine powder in your mouth (5-10 grams when starting, 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine) and drink the shake to wash the creatine down. It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water, as that makes creatine lose its potency.Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out. After this 5 minutes, allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2:After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes, consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin with one gulp of the shake.Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period.

Watch YouTube video first, and it'll be really clear how to apply.  Make sure, since the wax melts from the middle of jar first, to stir it to honey-like consistency.

GREAT results - left no redness which surprised me.

If you're using your home waxing to simply keep up/maintain after a professional Brazilian, it's super cost-effective and so much less pain because the hair is softer and more sparse -  and as long as you take care of it every few weeks, it's inexpensive, simple and works beautifully!

I was especially impressed by what you get, considering the price I paid. First thing that caught my attention was that it came in a soft gel form. Soft gels are generally better absorbed than tablets, and in my experience, are easier on the stomach. These soft gels come encapsulated in flax seed oil - this also helps with absorption, as certain fat soluble vitamins need a fat in order to be absorbed and this minimizes the need to take them with a meal that contains some fats. Also, they are twice a day, which is also better than the more popular one a day forms. Some people might find having to take them twice a day inconvenient, but if you are going for optimal absorption, you need to split vitamins up throughout the day as the body can only absorb a certain amount at a time, and if you are taking it once a day a portion of that is not going to get absorbed, unless you don&#8217;t mind breaking them in half.Also noteworthy is this Multi provides superior forms of each vitamin- meaning they clinically proven to be more bioavailable to the human body than their synthetic counterparts, e.g. Eve gives you vitamin A in beta carotene form, Vit. D as cholecalciferol, vitamin E as alpha tocopherol. The amounts of some are a little high but nothing to cause concern - RDA guidelines are always way lower than need be - and much more of a concern if the fat soluble vitamins are in a synthetic form.Some people have commented these are large - which they are- but these the soft gels have a smooth coating, so they go down fairly easy with a glass of water.OveraIl I think this is very good vitamin.

She had one years ago that was pure torture, never could figure out why anyone would use one for all the hassle and pain, a razor surely would have been faster and without the misery.I found that the original models used a rotating curved spring.  When you curve a spring the opening on the inside of the curve becomes very narrow to closed, while the spring on the outside is wider, this spring would rotate grabbing hair on the open side and while spinning the narrow side would grab the hair and pull it out.  Often the spring would break and have to be replaced.  This model uses spinning discs across the surface, two discs operate together slightly angled as to form a V between them.  The open part of the discs go over the hair pulling it into the closed section and remove the hair.  This unit has two speed settings, soft and fast, so you are able to select which is most comfortable.  Epilating is similar to getting waxed for hair removal.  The advantages of this unit are rather obvious if you have ever subjected your self to one of the original models.  You had to plug the unit into a wall socket which limited where you could use it.

One thing the Wahl didn't have however, was a nostril hair trimmer, so when this Philips Norelco groomer went on sale for $10, I decided to get it, mostly because it does have a nostril hair trimmer.  I didn't really need another grooming set, but paying only $10 for a nostril hair trimmer, didn't seem that outrageous.The first thing I noticed, was that the Norelco motor makes a lot more noise, when compared to the Wahl, which makes a low humming sound.  The Norelco motor is raspy, and it sounds like there is a lot of friction.  Strangely, while the quieter Wahl comes with a bottle of machine oil, Norelco claims that their groomer requires no lubrication.  It's not the most pleasant experience, sticking a noisy nostril trimmer into your nose, and it gets hot pretty fast, but it does a decent job.Besides the nostril hair trimmer, the Norelco has attachment heads for a hair clipper, a precision clipper, and a mini-shaver, with clip on combs for hair, moustaches, and beards.  These seem a bit oversized, but work pretty well, although the spacing between the comb teeth is rather wide.  While Norelco provides 2 comb attachments and a carrying pouch, the Wahl set comes with 7 assorted combs, and a zippered bag.At only about 0.6\" wide, the mini-shaver is quite small.  It works well enough, but again it's rather noisy.  The fit of some of the attachments isn't that secure.  A little too much pressure in a certain direction, and the mini-shaver, or nostril trimmer pop off.  Putting the release button immediately above the power switch, where it can accidentally be pressed, isn't a smart decision, and is another indication that workmanship and attention to detail, is just a little lacking.  The Norelco is decent grooming tool, but it's a bit rough around the edges.  Having used both products, I prefer the Wahl Groomsman, but many don't happen to agree, as the Norelco is a top seller at Amazon.  My cost of only $10, is a major factor in my 4 star rating.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a decent groomer, with a noisy motor...", "unixReviewTime": 1367107200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2013"}

It's not a magic 'let's all lose weight fast' pill. What it does do is help you control your food intake by making you feel full. No hunger = no eating. I only wanted to lose about four to five pounds off of my belly. After the holidays I was feeling a bit too chunky and I wanted to slim down. With that being said- my mind was saying &#34;eat eat eat&#34; constantly. I needed that to change!I did a bit of research on A-Rx. Never heard of them prior to seeing them on Amazon, but after reading a few reviews and a few online articles I thought &#34;Meh, why not?&#34;. I'm really happy I tried it. I prefer natural products, but for the price this one was more affordable. Within an hour of taking the first pill I felt full and for the remaining 10 hours had a normal appetite. I was no longer eating constantly- and then overeating what I did eat. I was eating normal sized portions, once or twice a day- and feeling full and happy.For the first few days I did feel some side effects. I got a bit dizzy because my body was used to taking in more calories. This isn't so much a side effect of the pill as it probably was my body telling me &#34;You're supposed to be eating more food than this&#34;. During those times I drank some Gatorade to help rehydrate myself, ate some filling fruit (bananas mostly), and some nuts- for protein. This quick snack meal would help my  body feel like it got the nutrients it needed and the dizziness would usually subside.After a week and a half (about 10 days) I had lost my targeted 5 pounds. Most of it was belly fat, and that's what I was hoping for. It helped me take off those extra pounds that I had gained during the holidays. Had I not gotten dizzy a few times, I would have rated this five stars. But the bottom line is that this product worked for me, did what it promised, and kept me from overeating.A plus for those who are looking for natural alternatives.

I took this supplement for one month along with a healthy diet (also gluten free).  I found that this supplement did noticeably lower my appetite.  However, I didn't notice any reduction in fat or loss of pounds although I did maintain a healthy weight.  As for stress reduction, this is one of those subjective measures that is hard to confirm.  I was (and still am) under a great deal of stress at work and I didn't really notice any stress reducing properties.  As for metabolism, I suspect the popular green coffee bean extract acting as a stimulant accounts for what many people consider an increase in metabolism.  I have had luck in the past with 7-Keto DHEA supplements to boost my metabolism and this supplement seemed to give me the same effect.  However, with no real loss of pounds (and I could stand to lose another 20), I guess there really wasn't much of an increase in metabolism.Like many supplements designed to promote weight loss, this one blends a lot of popular ingredients into a \"super pill\" that promises noticeable results.  Overall I'm not sure these pills worked for me.  In theory, the blend should be ideal for weight loss.  Truth be told, I have done better by altering my diet and watching what I eat and when.  I have increased my metabolism by factoring in some daily exercise too, and I think this is the combination that works best for me.

What a pain! But what a great resource. Amazon should charge for it since THEY are the real \"consumer reports\".....Well, I have had the same old ORAL B Braun for 20 years. Just wouldn't die. My wife is on her 3rd but mine finally had the metal shaft rust and literally broke off when I was brushing. That was scary actually but just because NOW I had a rusty metal shaft buzzing in my mouth.

I just ordered ONE as opposed to 3 since they last forever.I find I prefer this over my old Oral B. I like the larger brush head instead of that little round head I was used to. Maybe the Oral B would be best for little kids with little teeth? MY old choppers like this bigger head. Less work, less hassle. I have read all the worry about battery life & notice mine came with instructions on how to replace them once they fail. So now I agonize on how to charge this thing. On my Oral B that lasted 20 years, it remained in the charger stand ALWAYS! Now I read to not do that, only charge when the battery is drained. So while I agonize over which path I am going to take, I will simply enjoy my new tooth brush. Which brand is best? BOTH. It's JUST a darn toothbrush for Heavens sake. I just like this one best because it's \"new\".", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "No More Oral B For Me", "unixReviewTime": 1239321600, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2009"}

I figured for the price I could give them a try and if I didn't like them out for them away. They came packaged in an easy to open cardboard box from amazon. These razors were meant to replace my expensive fusion razors that cost way too much to use. The first try twith hese razors, it took a little bit of a learning curve. It seems like the razors themselves are at a different angle than the Gillette fusion razors. You have to hold the physical razor differently when it's going across your skin.  After I figured that out, I found that these razors deliver a fairly close shave with very limited razor burn. I've been using one razor cartridge for a while now, and have had no need to replace it. I will most likely use the remainder of the cartridges and then continue to buy more cartridges for it. I would say that is on par with the Gillette fusion.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice razor", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"}

A couple of weeks ago, while attempting to put the Rollator in the trunk of a friend's car, the tray was knocked off of its mount.  It's held in place by two little pegs coming out of the inside of the holder bracket.  Even though the entire holder was closed up, the tray was still knocked off.  Couldn't put back on because of of the pegs sheared off in the process.  So, be careful when loading the Rollator into and out of a folding position.
