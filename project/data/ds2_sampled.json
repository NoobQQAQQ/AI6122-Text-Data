This is a step up from Black Arrow on the XBOX, and from what I heard about Lockdown, Vegas blows it out of the water.  I have three shooters for the 360 and next to Gears of War this game is a close second.The storyline is actually pretty good, like the title suggests you will spend most of your time in Las Vegas taking out tangos in casinos and lavish hotels.The graphics in this game are done very well.  It looks like an XBOX 360 game is supposed to look, if you have an HD TV, that is even better.  It seems to me that every detail was taken care of down to the shadows cast on walls by your enemy and your teammates.  The detail of your weapons is also quite realistic.  You can actually tell the difference between each gun even down the camouflage design on one of the sniper rifles.  The environments are also done very well, down the tiny detail of bits of tumble weed blowing across your path in the train yard.Sound also gets two thumbs up.  You will really appreciate the sound if you have the optional optical audio cable for the 360 that allows you to connect your 360 to your A/V receiver via the optical input.  Crank the volume up, and you will feel as if you are there.  Nothing but crisp sound all around, if someone is talking to you and he is behind you, it will sound like he is behind you; spin around while he is talking to you and the sound moves from speaker to speaker accordingly.  If you don't have an A/V receiver, no worries, the sound effects in this game are still very good.  Guns sound very convincing and like they are supposed to.  In addition to this, sniper rifles actually sound powerful, and not that puny sound from Black Arrow.The game play is very fun for the most part.  The game can be quite challenging at parts, but the great placement of buttons on the XBOX controller, make controlling your character very simple.  Another thing I like about this game that wasn't in past Rainbow Six games is the ability to really cover.  In past games you may recall that \"covering\" just meant standing behind a wall and if you wanted to shoot at someone you had to leave cover completely to do so.  Not anymore, in Vegas your character can now take cover and fire at enemies without exposing your entire body to danger, this is definitely needed in this game because your enemies are a lot smarter and you WILL get killed frequently if you don't take advantage of this new feature.  You can even blind fire to keep your enemies at bay while not giving up any of your body (except for maybe your arm).For some reason you only have 2 other teammates in R6:Vegas instead of 3, I don't know what is up with that but oh well.  Your teammates are smartER than on Black Arrow.  Notice I said smart-ER.  They pretty much follow your directions, but sometimes they go into stupid mode still and when you tell them to move or regroup with you, they will continue to fire at the enemy and eventually get killed.  They no longer flash bang or frag themselves with their own grenades anymore as they did on the XBOX versions of the R6 games.  In addition to this, if they go down in the field, you can actually heal them or tell your other teammate to do so.  In fact, you HAVE to save them, because if you don't, they will eventually DIE for real and your mission is over.  This adds a great aspect to the game, but what I don't understand is if you go down, why can't they heal you instead of the mission being over completely?Now for the main thing I HATE about this game;  UBISoft's idea of having a checkpoint system in the game instead of or in addition to user initiated saves.  This is the ONE thing that makes this game so frustrating especially on Realistic difficulty.  I like a challenge and my first time through the game, I was challenged pretty well, but what I didn't like is having to repeat things I already did over and over and over and over again just because I didn't reach the next checkpoint before I got killed.  This is not my idea of fun, after the 3rd or 4th time spending 20 or more of going through the same stuff again, it starts to get old, boring and downright frustrating.  I had a little issue with this my first time through on Normal difficulty, but then after beating the game on Normal I went back and tried my hands at Realistic and while I loved the extra challenge, the current checkpoint save system really showed how flawed it is.  Realistic difficulty is way too difficult to only have this type of save system.  Sure it's beatable and I do like the challenge of Realistic difficulty, but the frustration of having to do things you spent so much time doing the same thing 5 and 6 times makes me not want to play anymore, especially since I already beat the gam anyway.  Games are supposed to be fun, which is why they are called \"Games\".  Apparently UBISoft thinks it is an absolute blast to force the players to play the same part of a level over and over and over and over again.  Call of Duty 3 suffered from this same flaw which is why I probably won't play it again after beating it the first time.  As I said with COD3 if they are only going to have a checkpoint save system at least make the checkpoints closer together.That being said this is still a great game.  Definitely fun on Normal difficulty, and if it wasn't for the save system problem it would be even more fun on \"Realistic\".  It's the save system that stopped me from giving this game 5 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great shooter that uses an idiotic save system.", "unixReviewTime": 1168646400, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2007"}

You play as an indian named Tommy who is in love with a girl named Jennifer and is torn between his native heritage and her love. When abducted by Aliens you escape near death only to be thrown into a world of madness and sick revolting creatures to save your girls life, in space. Not that it matters since this game is 4 years old, you actually die not long after the start and come back to life with the ability to leave your human body behind and going into the spirit body as to pass through walls and to complete certain tasks. This makes the game very unique in itself though the game does remind you a lot of Dooom 3 and also Quake. Your interactiveness with the game is also cool because you actually see your hand turning things on and off, even flushing toilets, and using hand dryers! Much like Bioshock, (but remember this game came first). This game however does have its own identity especially when it comes to being vile, the creatures are very liquidy and gross looking if that make sense, in other words the outer parts of there bodies are meat if that tells you anything. Reminds you a lot of something Clive Barker would come out with even sicker! There are large spores that give you energy, and also ones that spit out body parts all over the place, so yes this game is definitely for adults only, and there is a lot of fowl language as well, but a lot of it is very humorous. The weapons and shooting are spot on, and also the ability to walk on the ceiling and walls using gravity rails can make you wanna throw up yet makes it a lot of fun especially when killing enemies and watching them fall UP, or fly down. So if you like a lot of the pre-mentioned titles you'll love this game, pick it up used at GS for 3.99 or new still, for 9.99.

I loved to play Monopoly before I bought this video game so I was excited to see my pieces moving around.  There are things I like and don't about this game.I was hoping that I would be able to immediately play as my Mii but this feeling was rectified on many levels. First, you can't beat the original pieces, and now they're hilarious!  For example, I chose that little terrier dog piece, thinking I would be given a little silver terrier that moves around the board.  What I was given was a very stylish young woman, asymmetrical hairstyle, sunglasses, dangerously high heels, and then her little doggie is your terrier piece. The wheelbarrow is a barefoot country girl named Natalie who pushes the wheelbarrow. Each piece you select is accompanied by a person (each person has a name except for the terrier-woman who is just called \"dog\" in the Streets Monopoly board. I don't like that).  You don't have access to all the pieces, you have to win money and unlock them. The funniest thing is, the Miis you have created for your Wii are the city folk who walk around town. I attend school far from home, so my Mii people are members of my family.  My stylish woman was walking the dog around the corner of Free Parking and there was my sister, waiting to cross the street. A few minutes later, there's my mom walking down the sidewalk. Later, I found out that by winning games and thus earning money, you can \"buy\" your Mii so that you can play him or her in the game.The graphics are pretty cool. When you build on a property, a nice house or hotel goes right up. Naturally the hotel that gets built on Baltic Avenue is nothing compared to the ones built on Park Place or Broadway! Cars and trucks drive by on the street. The Banker reminds me of Lenny Briscoe from Law & Order because he always has these one-liners. If you have never played before, he walks you through the whole game, explaining every little detail. There are a lot more boards you can play, but most of them are locked. It only makes me want to play more, earn more money and unlock those boards.  I can't wait to see what they look like.What I don't like is that it seems to be fast-moving, to the point where I think it may be buggy. Before I buy a property and especially before accepting or rejecting a trade, I like to get a bird's eye view of the board to see who owns what first.  This is not possible. You may see the entire board before you roll your dice, but once you land on a property this feature is unavailable. Also, in the corner are all the cards/colors of the properties I own, but they are so darn small that I can barely make sense of them.  It would be nice if there were a button to temporarily amplify this view. When I played my first game, I would periodically be led to a screen that displayed the players' net worth, but I the screen went by so fast I kept thinking, what was that? Then about 15 minutes into the game, Mr. Banker stops at that screen to explain it.  Later when I declared bankruptcy and was taken back to that Net Worth scene, the screen just went black and stayed there until I pressed \"2\" to fast forward.I've only played the game a couple of times. I haven't played online yet but I'm looking forward to it and will be sure to come back and update when I do. I love playing this game by myself with a cup of tea, curled up on the couch but playing online against a stranger seems fun!UPDATE:  Although the above description says that you can play online, this is not possible with the Wii.  I've looked and looked for it in my game, until a comment by a reader led me to the EA.com page.  Online play is only available with the PS3 and Xbox.

This is the first time in my life I paid full retail price for a game, so I could play in right after it's released. I should have waited for the price to be slashed in half! It's really that unworthy!I have played about 50% of the game. I chose to write my review now because it will take me a long while before I complete the game, since I have no motivation to get to it. Anyway, here are some of my comments:[1] The gameplay sucks big time. In the first half of the game, there are only a few gun fights. Why replace the fun gun fights with these boring fist fights? I wanna play a shooting game, yo! Plus, why does the plot make Drake loose his guns so often? That's annoying![2] So far, the plot has been uninteresting and unsuspenseful. I actually have little desire to keep playing and finding out more about the next adventures.[3] Perhaps this is just me, but I feel that the controls in Uncharted 1 and 2 are way smoother.[4] The graphics continues to be good, but I personally think Uncharted 2 has better graphics. Uncharted 3 looks like Uncharted 1 to me, and that's not good. The human faces look more realistic, but that's about it. Oh, while still realistic, Elena and Chloe look different; they look prettier in Uncharted 2.[5] I like the (scenic) setting of Uncharted 1 and 2 better. The shipyard scene is so ugly to look at. On the other hands, the Himalayas in Uncharted 2 are gorgeous. Also, I don't like the pirates theme.[6] The puzzles are retarded. I can solve them pretty easily, but they are boring and annoying. I do like the fact that you can have the game just solve the puzzles for you. However, this option appears only after a period of \"inactivity\". I discovered this option when I took a snack break without pausing the game. Having this option without having to wait would be nice, so I can just bypass the puzzles and get to the gun fights.[7] Drake can only walk, not run, in too many scenes. That makes exploration slow.[8] Contrary to the majority, I could care less about online plays. When I play games, I want it to be offline, alone or co-op with the most one person sitting right next to me. This is just my personal preference. I am not deducting any stars for it.I know I may anger many Uncharted fans out there, but I am ready for it since these are my honest opinions.Update: I initially rated this game as three stars. I am taking off two more stars for the annoying desert chapter. Thank you for screwing up big time, Naughty Dog! Uncharted fans out there, please feel free to leave comments. I never read them anyway.Update: I finally finished the game, and it didn't get any better. I am sticking with my one-star rating. The co-op mode also sucked.

With bots I can enjoy good multiplayer action without having to put up with all of the...how do you say 'idiots' nicely?...that you run into in online multiplayer. So that was a real plus.The single-player was an interesting experience, too. I wanted to like it. I really, really wanted to like it. But, like many games seem to be doing these days, I think Black Ops went too far with the content. The general gameplay wasn't so bad, but the single-player campaign contained some extremely violent and disturbing assassinations and such. There really was a lot of unnecessarily gruesome content. Yes, there is an option to turn off excessive gore and profanity, but even with that option on it was more than I ever want my kids to see.So, unfortunately, I had to get rid of it. I enjoyed it while I had it, but the more I played the more I realized it had crossed the line for me.

Stickers may be cosmetic features (tattoos, hats, celebration animations), planter items, parts of unlockable characters (when you collect all 5 stickers for a character you can use it in game, these are variants of the primary characters) or other benefits.  There are a handful of game modes ranging from local split screen to horde mode conquest (I've spent nearly all my time on a mode called Team Vanquish -- 12 vs. 12 battle, first team to 50 kills wins).

Once I began to unbox the MANUFACTURER's packaging, the worrying started.  I had read a number of reviews here on Amazon and was reluctant to buy this product, yet a strong desire to experience \"As Close To Real As It Gets\" drove me to order this Pro Flight Yoke/Throttle plus the matching Pro Flight Rudder Pedals (both are Saitek products).This item appeared to have been previously opened, as the usb cords were haphazardly wound up and not tied like 'brand new' merchandise.  The throttle levers were flimsy plastic and appeared to be warped or not 100% straight as you would expect throttle levers to be.  The 'extra knobs' to allow you to create a matched pair for throttles in a 2-engine jet and a different color knob say for flaps were totally MISSING from my order.  Still, I plowed ahead and assembled the units and plugged them into my high-end gaming PC.  A number of reviewers have spoken about the fact that the throttles do not easily return to the 'fully off' position (they stop short by design, but you have to be careful not to take them too far down, or you will engage the reverse thrusters).  In actual flight conditions, these things were a huge disappointment.  They don't move smoothly and don't feel \"solid\" or \"heavy duty\".  The words \"cheap\" and \"flimsy\" come to mind, but I'm just sayin'...Of course, like anyone who has been to the rodeo before, I ran a full system image backup PRIOR to installing this new Saitek stuff.  Good thing.I had a number of problems configuring the Yoke and all of the buttons that come with it.  I also run EZ DOK Camera software, and while I was able to configure the yoke to switch camera views, during actual flight, some of the yoke buttons did not operate as I had programmed them to.  Especially annoying was the fact that two different buttons on the yoke disconnected the AutoPilot (CMD button) on my PDMG 737NGX during flight.)  I tried but failed to solve that issue.Still, I wasn't ready to throw in the towel.  However others have written about how the yoke, while having a stainless steel SHAFT, must have a very poor bearing assembly, because it would frequently 'stick' when pushing in or pulling out (to Ascend or Descend the aircraft).  Handling the plane with these items was (to put it bluntly)  not enjoyable (mildest polite words I could think of).  The plane yawed incessantly, climbed and descended and was near impossible to hold in level flight if the Auto Pilot was disengaged.All in all, this product pair (the Yoke/Throttle plus the matching Rudder Pedals) left me with a good sized headache - and that was prior to trying to unassemble and re-box everything.  Not my favorite packaging by the manufacturer!  The words \"Chinese Water Torture\" come to mind, but I'm just saying...  Well, everything goes back to Amazon and my Joystick is back as my aircraft interface hardware.  Not happy.  Luckily my system is restoring from the backup I ran just before unboxing this Amazon order.  If you don't have a full system backup strategy you are living on a prayer, as Bon Jovi says...I guess for $220 street (for both Saitek items) I shouldn't have expected much, and these products weren't.Reviews are personal opinions and anecdotal in nature, and keep in mind, your mileage may vary.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Hugely Disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1322438400, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2011"}

It's almost enough to make you think that the PS4 isn't really necessary and there's still a lot of life and untapped potential in the PS3.In any case, this game has a good mix of fighting and problem solving, and unlike so many of the 1st person shooters, it's not a &#34;game on rails&#34;, although there are times where it seems like the other characters are all waiting for you at the next action point and you just need to get there to trigger it.Beyond that one annoyance, the story, acting and visuals are all amazing and it is a really enjoyable game to play through. I haven't hit any bugs/glitches yet which is reassuring. I don't think the replay value will be high for this, once you finish you won't want to go back.

The game has an interesting story and a very neat combat system, but the graphics are terrible.The storyline keeps you interested, as you try and regain your kingdom in China.  At first, things are a little confusing because of the way you view things.  This can hurt some because you basically are thrust right into the game without a tutorial.  But after awhile, things get easier and you start to progress with ease.The game is your basic hack and slash third person game with the goal to kill your enemies and get to the end of the level.  Occasionally, you have to complete tasks, like planting bombs or opening gates, but these are straightforward and usually easy to do.  The game does get tougher later and figuring out how to complete certain levels can take a long time.You can use up to two weapons at once, either one of two kinds of two of the same, and they can do some interesting combos.  There is a lot to choose from, as well, from swords to bows to guns to other special weapons you get from beating regular enemies and bosses.  The variation allows you to pick and choose what weapon is right for you, which is a plus.What makes this game fun is working your way through some pretty huge levels.  Each level looks different and has different characteristics, which is fun.  Also, you have help from allies in most of the levels, although they tend to go off on their own, leaving you to dispatch the bad guys, which isn't hard.That leads me to my next point.  While I like facing easy enemies, the lack of variety can make fighting almost seem like a chore.  There are only basically a few types of enemies and, while they vary what weapon they have, each is roughly the same.  It gets to the point where you wonder if the developers developed the enemies last, although the bosses are very cool and present their own unique challenges.The main problem with this game comes from the graphics.  It looks like a Playstation game.  That's the original Playstation, not the Playstation 2.  Characters, for the most part, are blocky, as are the foregrounds.  The motions are also very choppy and not at all smooth.  There is also framerate slowdown like you wouldn't believe in certain parts of the game.Another problem is that there are times when the gameplay stops momentarily to restart the music, which isn't worth restarting for the most part.  Also, in order to check your goals when they change, you have to pause the game, which can get annoying.  Finally, the camera angles swing around enough to make you seasick.  It also can make fighting extremely difficult.Overall, this is one of those \"rent before you buy\" games.  Some people can look past the surface and see the great gameplay elements at the heart of New Legends.  Others won't be able to look past the poor graphics.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Gameplay, Horrible Graphics", "unixReviewTime": 1015027200, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2002"}

This new movie tie-in Incredible Hulk game from Sega seems to want to follow in the same footsteps, but alas, it is a disappointing, and quite frankly boring, next-gen smash-a-thon.  Smashing up a pretty looking New York City is as fun as one would hope, and is by far the best aspect of the game to be sure.  After that though, things begin to go downhill in terms of gameplay and overall presentation.  Once you get bored with just causing destruction, the gameplay elements at their core just aren't that varied, and the boss fights are underwhelming as well.  Graphically, the game looks halfway decent, but there are noticeable graphical glitches and occasional bugs that hamper the experience.  Oddly enough as well, just like with the Iron Man game that was recently released, the game's cut-scenes are just plain bad.  The good points of the game once again involve laying waste to the environment, and film star Edward Norton lends his voice as Bruce Banner as well.  Considering how enjoyable Ultimate Destruction was and still is, it's disappointing how Incredible Hulk ends up faring.

{"reviewerID": "A2KKJGDIWM4LWX", "asin": "B00005ULXN", "reviewerName": "Destroyahirismix666", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "With the release of Sonic Adventure 2 HD on the PS3/Xbox 360 several weeks ago, and (I think) Steam in a few weeks, I'm going to turn my attention to the Gamecube port of this game.(Just to let you know, just because you don't have a GC, doesn't mean you can't play it. Most Wii systems support GC games if you have a GC memory card and controller.)-Background: Almost 15 years ago, SEGA's Sonic Team released one of the best-known games of the famed Sonic the Hedgehog Series: Sonic Adventure, for their new SEGA Dreamcast console in Japan, and a year later in America. It was a hit. Three years after the Japanese release, they made a sequel for it. This game. Many people liked Sonic Adventure, and most of the same people enjoyed the original Dreamcast version of Sonic Adventure 2, that system died out mere months afterwards. Nintendo's Gamecube console picked up the game, and suddenly, the game that many people consider Sonic Team's greatest achievement was open to Millions of Game players.-Plot: Normally, I'd tell you the plot. However...it's not really anything that you haven't heard by now. Almost any other review will tell you.-Controls: The simplicity/difficulty varies on familiarity with the controller. I was lucky, as this was my first game on my first game system, so I was very open when it came to learning the controls.L and R triggers: Camera turnA Button: Jump. Tap again with Sonic/Shadow to preform a homing attack, to float with Tails/Eggman, or to glide with Knuckles/RougeB Button: Primary Action Button. Spindash, Light Speed dash/attacks, kicks, weapon aiming/firing, etc.X Button: Secondary Action Button. Does everything the 'B' button does, except for Light Speed Dash/Attack.Y Button: Action Selection button *This comes in handy for Treasure Hunting levels with Knuckles/Rouge*Main Control Stick: Moves the character, obviously.C Stick: NothingZ Button: Nothing-Gameplay: It's mostly simple. You have four types of levels.1: Sonic/Shadow have the famed speed levels, where you need to get your character to the end of the level as fast as you can, smashing enemies along the way. You might not be able to Boost/Drift/Sidestep, moves that are a staple in More Modern Sonic games, but the lack of those abilities make the game pleasantly challenging. The only downside is that two/three hits in a row, and you instantly die, regardless of how many rings you had.2: Tails/Eggman have mecha-shooting levels, which are reminiscent of E-102 Gamma's levels out of Sonic Adventure. Shoot more stuff at once for bigger point bonuses. These also are 'get to the goal ring/level end' as soon as you can levels, but taken at a slower pace. For example, Metal Harbor, a Sonic level can be completed in 1:30 Flat. Dr. Eggman has Weapons Bed, which takes place in the same general area, and I think the fastest I have seen there is about Three minutes... These are a pain in the but, as the Mechas these two drive are clunky and a bit unresponsive, but you eventually should get the hang of it.3: Knuckles/Rouge have treasure-hunting levels. Many players hate these levels, but I like the challenge and level exploration. Reminiscent of Knuckle's 'find three emerald shards' missions in Sonic Adventure, these two have to find 'three somethings' rather it be Chaos Emeralds, Master Emerald Shards, Keys, whatnot. These levels have NO goal ring, just to let you know. While it may sound hard, the task is made easier because the two of them have special radars that go off when you are nearest to one of the objects. The radar isn't as good as it was in Sonic Adventure, but it still helps a ton. Just in-case that isn't good enough, there are also hint screens that *usually* tell you helpful information. {Mad Space, one of my favorite hunting levels, would be the exception as everything the hint boxes tell you there is A: prac sdrawkcab or B: DEAD RIGHT (AKA, Totally a lie).}4: Driving. There are only two levels and three sub-games with Driving style. Tails and Rouge drive, respectively, a car-version of the Tornado II and a Phallus, where you have to beat the clock to get to level's end. The sub-games are one/two player cart races, at three different tracks, where the goal is to beat everyone else in a three-lap dash. Sounds easy? It's not. All six carts driven by the six main characters have different stats. Rouge and Tails get up to speed fast, but don't have much of it. Eggman has lots of speed, but it takes time to get up there. Just as a recommendation, either wait until you unlock special carts to tackle this mini-game, or use trail-and-scream-and-error to beat these.-Re-playability: This is one of the two areas the game shines at. Every level has five-different 'missions'.Mission 1 is get to the end/find all the object. (Sometimes with a time limit)Mission 2 is always get 100 rings.Mission 3 is find a 'hidden Chao' somewhere in the level, [In the Driving levels, it's basically Tails and Rouge need to complete the mission without hitting cars]Mission 4 is 'complete Mission 1 in a certain amount of time'. These are usually the hardest. [Again, the driving levels version of Mission 4 is different, as Tails and Rouge have to get to the end without hitting walls. This will cause a Rage-fest]Mission 5: 'Hard Mode'. Depending on the level, this could actually be more fun then Mission 1, or a huge headache. It's just Mission 1 with more enemies and slightly-changed level.Now get this. You need to get every, single, freaking, one, of these missions done, with an 'A' rank. A ranks are earned by earning a Certain amount of Points in Missions 1, 4, and 5, and by completing it under a certain amount of time in missions 2, 3, and the driving courses. Every character who gets their missions done with all A ranks unlock: A bonus cart for the Kart races with very interesting stats, and a special costume for Multi-player. Get all of these, along with completion of 'Boss runs','Kart Races',and 'Chao Crap' to earn all 180 special Emblems. This will take...months to years, depending on how good you are and how much time you spend on this game. When all 180 of them are earned, yippy, you get a secret level, AKA, a 3-D Green-Hill, even though it isn't as good as the remake in Sonic Generations from what I've seen.-Multiplayer: This is the other area the game shines in. 2P Battle was quite limited and copy-pasted in the Dreamcast version, IN the Gamecube, that is no longer true. I'll run through the varying types of stages for multiplayer.Action Race: Play as Sonic or Shadow through 8 levels from the game and two special ones. The levels are: City Escape, Metal Harbor, Green Forest, Final Rush, Radical Highway, White Jungle, Sky Rail, and Final Chase, along with Pyramid Race *Nothing but grinding with minimal running* and Downtown race *Nothing but skateboarding down a San-Fransisco clone* You can also play as Amy Rose, or Metal Sonic. All four of these characters have special things about them that will help you when you play. Amy is slow, but every ten rings she picks up gives her a power-up that will either speed her up, attack your opponent, or freeze your opponent in place for a brief period of time. Sonic is faster, but takes 20 rings to earn a power-up, which do the same basic things. Shadow is the same as Sonic, but is just slightly faster (Don't argue with me here, I have tested this). Metal Sonic is twice Sonic's speed, but earns no power-up from rings at all. However, he does get a shiny little shield that protects him from attacks. The main goal of these races is to, you guessed it, get to the Goal Ring before your opponent. Sonic and Shadow have special unlock-able costumes (Earned by A-ranking all of their missions) which make them go slightly faster and give them power-ups quicker.Shooting Battle: I don't remember the names of these levels. Sorry. However, you can play as Eggman or Tails, both in their machines, and have to kill your opponent in a small, enclosed space. This isn't really a 'great' multi-player dynamic, but it's better then what a slow race would look like between them. You can also control a Chao in a giant machine shaped like a Chao, or a Dark Chao in a giant machine shaped like a Dark Chao. Tails and Eggman's special machines (Earned by A-Ranking all of their missions), to my knowledge, do nothing different...ouch.Treasure Hunting Race: These are fun if you bother to take the timer off for this. Wild Canyon, Pumpkin Hill, Death Chamber, Meteor Herd, Dry Lagoon, Egg Quarters, Security Hall, and Mad Space make up these levels, along with two bonus mini, based off of sections of Mad Space and Aquatic Mine. You can control Knuckles, Rouge, Tikal (Echidna girl from Sonic Adventure) and Chaos Zero (Main bad-guy from Sonic Adventure). The goal is to earn two out of three Master Emerald Shards first (Except in Security Hall, where, true to the level, you need to find Chaos Emeralds). However, the levels are so large, and you can really have fun just exploring around, especially if you enjoyed adventure fields in Sonic Adventure/06/Unleashed.Chao Battles: Nothing special. No Comment.Kart Racing: Use the same karts and tracks from Single-Player and put them in 2-Player, and you can use any of the unlocked carts. That's it. While it may not sound like much, this will become quite fun if you can compete with someone who is decently good at the kart-racing.-Final Judgement: The game is complex. The Plot is complex. The Gameplay itself is pretty darn simple, or pretty darn complicated, depending on how you look at it. This game will challenge you for a long time. For instance, I've logged over 100 Hours of gameplay and I still only have a bit over 110 emblems. The Multiplayer is fun, and doubles the game's replay value. The Music, something I didn't mention above, is probably the best out of any Sonic game, and with some of the widest variety, from Rock to Jazz to Techno to Rap, and they all get you revved up. The Biggest down-side is probably the bloody Chao crap. Like it's predecessor, Sonic Adventure, you have these stupid Chao gardens where you have to raise these dumb beasts to win races or karate stuff. Many people scream that this is the best part of the game (Sonic Retro went as far as to say that this was the 'meat of the game' while the rest of it was crap), I say it should have been totally cut out. Sadly, to earn 100 percent completion, you will have to mess with that forever.If it wasn't for that chao crap and the lack-luster Shooting-style levels, this would be the perfect game. I'd give it a 4.5/5 aka 9/10, because everything else is JUST THAT GOOD! I raised the rating to a five here, because Amazon was exact at shipping dates, and it arrived in good condition. Definitely something I would recommend for anyone, on any system.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Don't let the Haters turn you away from this gem", "unixReviewTime": 1352160000, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2012"}

There are no quest trackers, and so quest tracking doesnt exist, I.E. the big white arrows from Skyrim and the Quest Menu in Skyrim. SO, it is really hard. There is some \"build an army function\", but you have to fight 100 people by yourself to start building it it seems, unless I missed something but as I sadi theres no direction, so missing something would not be out of the question. You are supposed to build the army, but they don't fightwith you leaving you to defend against the increasing number of baddies by yourself.

I always prefer the former problem to the latter.This controller has been the target of a great deal of criticism over a few things that commonly go wrong with it.  Since buying it in April, with consistently heavy use, I have had two problems with it.  First the strum bar was sticking in the down position instead of re-centering.  The guitar is extremely easy to open up, and inside you can see that a couple of small sponges are being relied upon to bounce the bar back into position.  Simple, but ineffective in the long run.  It was amazingly easy to put two small rubber bands in place that had it working again.  Second, I had a problem with the whammy bar not springing back into position.  Once again, rubber bands to the rescue!  A rubber band stretched from the strap-anchor at the bottom of the guitar around the base of the whammy bar, and voila!  Good as new.So despite the problems with the design, kudos to the manufacturer for at least making the mechanical aspect of the design so incredibly simple that any idiot can fix it.I have never played a guitar game on anything other than this controller, so I cannot compare this to the wireless Les Paul replica, for example, used in Guitar Hero.  I understand that it, too, has problems.  The bottom line is that these are not just pieces of electronics -- they're mechanical devices.  Mechanical devices should be expected to require some repair if they are being put to heavy use.  I'd rather have a problem that can be fixed with rubber bands than one that requires a soldering iron or a re-wiring job, that's for sure.The range on the wireless guitar is great (I could play the game from another room away if I wanted to), the controls are responsive, so no complaints other than the mechanical problems, which were easily surmounted.  At present (September '08), this guitar works not only with with the XBox360 version of Rock Band, but also with Guitar Hero: Aerosmith (I have tested it to confirm that.)  It is being reported that it will work with Guitar Hero: World Tour, due out later this year.

However when MK went to 3D graphics & fighting plain, it lost something to me, and each new game became more and more complicated to play, almost to the point where I felt I needed a PhD to play it effectively. I had all but given up on MK...Then along comes MK9, or simply Mortal Kombat. A reboot, that has gone back to it's 2D roots, and kept the dazzeling 3D graphics! I was excited for a MK release for the first time in a long time, and my excitement was well placed. This IS Mortal Kombat! It is everything the old games were and much, much, more!

The blood is there, but toned down a little bit, to make it more realistic. Fatalities are also not overly difficult to execute (pun intended lol) and are a plenty (each character has at least 3). So many modes I doubt I'll ever unlock everything. Online is easy to set up matches, and offers unlimited re-playability.All of these things together makes for an A+ title, but the thing that impressed me most, is the Story Mode. The Story Mode is the best of any fighting game I have ever played. It seamlessly blends the story with the Kombat, and every fight has a reason. The story covers at least all 3 original games (I'm still working on it and that's as far as I've gotten so far), and really fleshes out the MK story way more than the original games ever did. Most story modes in fighting games can be completed in an hour or two, but I have been working on MK's story mode for 3 nights straight, and still don't think it's coming to an end anytime soon. MK's Story Mode could be a game all by itself, and I would buy it!All-in-all, if you don't have Mortal Kombat yet, what are you waiting for? Pick this gem of a fighting game up now, you won't be disappointed!FYI: If you intend to play MK online (which I highly recommend), make sure you buy a new copy. If you buy used, chances are you will have to buy a Kombat Pass, unless for some reason the previous owner didn't use theirs. It will just save you money & aggravation in the long run to buy new. Which honestly you should do anyway. Support your game developers folks!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "MORTAL KOMBAT!!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316044800, "reviewTime": "09 15, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "ADJXL0W0RJ7VV", "asin": "B00005NIT9", "reviewerName": "Lord Chimp", "helpful": [41, 44], "reviewText": "I desperately wanted to like this game. As a strategy RPG, Hoshigami occupies a very niche corner of the video game world. Truthfully, I'm obsessed with strategy RPGs, and I'm always eager to devour new ones (which are rare, you see). Games like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, two titles which heavily influence Hoshigami, are some of my all-time favorites. I love them for their exciting battles and elaborate character micromanagement systems.So, when I started up Hoshigami, I was impressed. It looks pretty good (along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics), the story is interesting, and it seems intelligently designed, intricate, and difficult. I love a challenge. But I was betrayed...as I played further, Hoshigami became a chore, subject to a stupid loophole in the gameplay that made the entire thing quite ridiculous (I will explain below).The big 'innovation' here is the RAP system. Each character has RAP points, which are consumed by executing actions (movement, attacks, etc.) I can see how a system like this could be applied to enhance the game's strategy, but something went wrong. In the end, the system only empowers certain characters to make an extra attack or move a few more spaces every turn. All that really happens is you end up pressing the button a few more times every turn, which makes already slow battles slower. Oh my. Why not just give a character more movement? More attacks?Spells appear on little goodies called Coinfeigms. You can equip characters with Coinfeigms, and elective magic is an idea I really like. The number of Coinfeigms to be collected is very impressive, too. However, they are entirely useless. For all the game's difficulty, spells imbued in Coinfeigms are hopelessly underpowered. Further evidence that spells are completely unavailing is found in the fact that as I played through the game, none of my characters were ever slain by an enemy's spell.In Hoshigami's polytheistic world, your characters develop skills by following a specific god and gaining powers through devotion. Devotion levels rise just like experience levels, so fighting makes you more devoted, getting you more abilities...right? Right. This was a very intriguing idea (unique skills according to different gods), but the developers messed up. Firstly, it takes forever to raise your levels. The stretches between levels are long, long, LONG. Secondly, the skills you earn with higher devotion levels are almost always useless. These two things make the game very difficult.And I mean VERY difficult. Anyone who plays Hoshigami is sure to get slaughtered several times in the first few battles. The enemies are far more powerful than your team, and you are almost always outnumbered. Plus, if a character dies, he's dead -- resurrection only becomes possible much later in the game. Initially, I was glad for a challenge, but there is a fine line between \"challenging\" and \"morbidly frustrating\"...and Hoshigami crosses that line.The only _apparent_ way to strengthen your party is to enter the Towers of Trial, which serve as training grounds for your characters. The Towers made me want to kill myself, quite honestly. They are stunningly boring, with repetitive battle maps, monsters, and everything else. I didn't want to train in these Towers, which were degenerating my sanity, but how else could I be match for the game's ridiculously hard battles?So I discovered the \"stupid loophole\" I mentioned above. Instead of using a full team of characters, I used just two: Fazz (the main character) and one other mercenary. My mercenary would be a dummy fighter to draw enemy attacks while Fazz did the fighting. Usually my mercenary would get killed quickly, but I could always hire a more powerful one later. Even if the mercenary survived, any experience he gained would still leave him at a level lower than another mercenary I hire, so there was no point in keeping him. The beauty of it all? Fazz accrued 99% of the experience and became a death machine. It was mildly difficult at first, but soon I was able to kill most enemies in one or two hits. It became even easier when my weapon of choice became a bow & arrow so I could kill from a distance.Suddenly, a viciously difficult game became mindlessly easy. I must say, I don't like strategy RPGs to be \"mindless.\" I pushed on to the end to see what would happen in the moderately entertaining story, but the gameplay was probably making me stupider with every battle. Granted, the fact that I could defeat 15 enemies with just two characters was somewhat amusing for a few battles, but it became very boring, very quickly. A game that is too difficult is not fun. A game that is too easy is not fun either. With Hoshigami, it's either too easy or too difficult -- either way, it's not fun.Get Tactics Ogre on GBA and skip Hoshigami.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Ultimately frustrating and unrealized.", "unixReviewTime": 1019433600, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2002"}

Players take the roles of Russian and German soldiers as they fight across fields, through city streets, and into apartment complexes. What sets it apart from most other FPS games is the way the game handles; rather than having ever gun be bolted directly to your frame, Red Orchestra handles in a very realistic manner, with the gun swaying based on its movement and requiring proper sighting to get a good hit. It's also, naturally, a highly lethal game, so speed and caution are both required.Gamers who have played RO1 will be largely familiar with the way the game works. The basic elements - the classes, the gunplay - are only slightly modified. There's far less vehicle action in the current map lineup, but the basic infantry aspects of the game are basically similar. One of the new additions is the cover system; while traditional leaning and crouching still exist and can be used just fine, the option also exists to stick to cover. This allows you to pop over cover to take a shot and then pop back down. It also allows you to fire blind from your safe position, though since the game stays in first person mode it's only effective as a last-ditch resort.Another new addition to the game is the way suppression works. In RO1, \"suppression\" existed in the sense that its easy to tell when you're being shot at; the screen shakes, there's loud pings and whizzes, and so on. This meant that you knew not to stick your head out, which naturally kept you from firing back effectively. In RO2, suppression also has more direct psychological effects; being kept under sustained fire will cause your screen to blur and mess with your vision. This means that even apart from the risk of being hit, taking potshots at a suspected enemy position also has negative effects on that enemy. The system has kind of mixed results - it felt like they toned down the actual \"I'm being shot at\" feel - but overall it provides a way for guns to be helpful without directly hitting enemies.The game's graphics are an obvious improvement from the first game, but the tradeoff is that it doesn't feel quite as smooth. Once I got used to it, the game handled okay, but in general the bloom and coloration of RO2 may be difficult for RO1 players to adapt to. However, as a game it looks pretty great - on par with other FPS games, at least. The materials and soldiers feel very well done and add to the game's intended realistic feel. The game's realism also supports gameplay; uniforms blend into some environments, and lighting is a big deal when you're trying to watch for enemy units. This means that the game is hard, but rewards sharp-eyed or quick-witted players.The sound design is pretty well done too; the music gets a little overbearing and annoying, but one thing I really liked is the automatic battlecries done by the soldier, indicating whether a character is pinned, needs ammo, is currently pinning an enemy, and so on. In an interesting touch, the faction the player is part of speaks accented English, and the enemy faction always speaks their actual language (so if you're playing as the Russians, all the Russians speak English with Russian accents and all the Germans speak actual German). This helped create a divide between \"our team\" and \"their team\" no matter which side you were on.Without a doubt, though, the game is currently buggy as heck. The stat system (connected to RPG-style advancements) randomly gives you bonuses or unlocks achievements you didn't earn. The actual gameplay has gone through a lot of patches following its release, but each one seems to unbalance as much as it balances. These bugs, combined with the general difficulty of the game, may drive away some more casual players. However, gamers who want a truly hardcore experience may be able to put up with the gripes to get a truly distinct FPS experience.Rating: 8/10.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "a truly distinct FPS experience", "unixReviewTime": 1321056000, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2011"}

With those games, you can have a party, kids-adults of all ages can start having fun, immediately.With Dance Masters, there's a lot to learn just so you can play it.  My wife and I wanted to test this out (I wish I had just rented it!) and we got a 'Failed' in our very first song.  We decided we'd go into Lesson Mode and really give this game a chance and we got up to Lesson 8 and were bored.  We tried another song and got through it, but the fun wasn't there and we'd get \"Perfect\" when we could see we weren't accurate in the poses or gestures.

If I had to compare it to other games it would be Hellgate London, or maybe Stalker though I've never played that Multiplayer and am not sure if it even has the capability.One thing that stands out with Borderlands is that the game is never boring, never tedious, never a grind. You collect quests, then it kicks straight into FPS mode as you fight your way through area's or instances to the objectives. The balance is very well done and the area's feel dangerous requiring to really think your way through a fight until you outlevel the area. While the AI isn't the smartest I've seen they make up for it by sheer number and the environment you encounter them in. Sitting back in sniper mode isn't always the best solution to a battle and while it does work, I've found repositioning to take advantage of cover and a maps various explosives to be both more rewarding and often quicker than the headshot approach.Graphics, sounds and animations are all done very well. You will get a little bored of seeing the same wastelands after a few hours of play, and a larger variety of enemy types would be great (note: they already have one downloadable expansion pack that adds new stuff). There are a huge variety of weapons, most of them going directly to vendors to purchase ammo. Anything purchased from a vendor other than ammo is a waste of money, as you'll certainly find better as soon as you buy it. As a result all the various vending machines you'll find scattered throughout zones are more to offload what you pickup vice actually buy anything from. And money begins to hold little value. I've several mid level characters approaching the million dollar point even after buying some of the vendor trash for my friends when we team together. As bag space is extremely limited at first, you'll be visiting vending machines very often and spending alot of time just trying to compare equipment and looking at the games UI.While single player is fun, multiplayer kicks things up a notch when your with some friends and have vent or other voice comms. You can connect upto 4, and the more players you have the more enemy spawn. Enemies become much tougher and drop better loot. Loot you can take back with you in your single player game. So there's real advantage to working with others as you progress through the game, and I think game developers should start doing the single/multi player experience as Borderlands has it.I hope this game does extremely well, it's really fills a void and I see it having unlimited expansion potential.

I loved the unique landscapes, the static leveling system, & the unique loot that you could find anywhere.  I weigh nearly ever RPG I play against the feeling I had when I first played Morrowind - I was completely engrossed in the environment of that game & have never found a game that could rival it.  While Divinity 2:  DKS is not on the same level as Morrowind for me, it does have enough great features that it is a complete steal at $40.While Divinity II is billed in some of these reviews as an \"open world\" or \"sand box\" RPG, it really isn't in my mind.  This is really one of my only criticisms of the game (and the reason it received an overall 4* score from me instead of a 5*).  Taking Dragon form is phenomenal, one of the better experiences I have had in an RPG, but my enthusiasm for it is somewhat limited due to this not being a truly \"open world\" game.  All I could think of when flying as a dragon was \"Why can't I fly any higher?\" or \"Why can't I fly over there?\"  I'm a Dragon, after all, I should be able to travel wherever I choose to go.  Don't get me wrong, though the game isn't as open as Morrowind or Oblivion, it is more open than a game like Dragon Age or Fable - so your ability to roam freely is pretty good, but it feels just a bit to linear for me to give it that 5th star.  The world you explore, though somewhat restrained, is very colorful and bright, and while the graphics aren't going to blow you away, they also aren't bad - kind of middle of the road.Where this game really shines is its leveling system/gameplay.  As I mentioned, one thing I LOVED about Morrowind was the ability to run into a level 15 character at level 1 and get your clock cleaned.  I hate games with leveled enemies.  For me, Oblivion destroyed the best part about Morrowind when it included leveled enemies & loot in the game.  When I become the savior of a land, an almost godlike deity, there is NO REASON a common road thug should have the same level of stats/gear that I do....leveled enemies destroy the realism of a world for me.  Divinity 2 does a great job of making you struggle early (often running into some higher level characters), but at the end of the game, you'll be so powerful that you can destroy any foe in the game.  Players should have to adjust to a game - not the other way around, and in Divinity 2 it feels like I am adjusting to the game.  Also, this game doesn't hold your hand with a convenient little arrow showing you where to go for your active quest, the game requires you to think things through and discover where your next quest is on your own - I greatly respect that.The leveling system is quite good as well - it requires you to consider what kind of player you want to become and start building character skills that have an end purpose (due to passive skills that support active skills).  You really can play this game in just about any way you choose.  There is random/leveled loot throughout most of the game, which I don't particularly like (I would rather it be static and the same in every game), but the loot is usually useful and aids you in your quests.Ultimately, I really hope they create a sequel to this one and end up going full \"open world\" with it.  If there were just a bit more time put into this one, I feel like it could have been one of the best RPG's I have ever played.

If you're looking for a Brain Age \"puzzler\" for PSP, this is as close as it gets. There are two good things I can say about this game. First, it's enjoyable to take the Mind Quiz Test...the one you can only take once a day...to see how your score today compares to your score yesterday. After playing for four days, I went down 20 years in age. The second good thing about this game are the adorable animal pictures you get as a reward when doing the training quizzes and receiving an A on those quizzes.The cons are that the quizzes are tedious and you feel like you're working on a game rather than PLAYING a game. Doing simple arithmetic, pressing corresponding buttons, memorizing 7 numbers, counting shapes and boxes, and selecting colors is not really my idea of a good time, no matter how many animal pictures you send my way.But while it may not be my cup of tea, it may be yours.

Mario Kart Super Circuit was my first, and after playing it for hours on end, I didn't believe that there could exist a better (or even comperable) GBA game. I was wrong.I had played THPS 2 for GBA on my friend's handheld and thought it was great. The graphics were unbelievable, and the gameplay was exceptional. After 3 came out, I decided to give it a try. Here's how I say the new one ranks compared to the old one.Graphics: Have improved a surprising amount since THPS 2, including the fact that the skater is larger, allowing you to see him easier.Sound: Incredible sound for a handheld console, easy to listen to and not easy to get sick of.Gameplay: Great gameplay, as with THPS 2, but I'd say that 3 stands out more. One thing I noticed right away is that the maps are huge compared to the previous version. There is a lot more skateable area.Overall, I'd say that although the changes may be subtle in their own respective categories, the total improvement definetely puts THPS 3 higher than 2.

As many others have said it's very God of War-ish, but as they have also said, that's not really a bad thing.  If God of War is an egg sunny side up then Dante's inferno is an egg scrambled with human eyeballs and frog toes thrown in for flavor.  The game in general is plain GRUESOME.  But nowadays this is parallel with good entertainment.--PROS---Voice Acting: this is usually one of my biggest pet peevs about a game, but Dante's inferno does it quite well ... the voices are believable if not slightly exaggerated.  But let's face it ... Dante shouting full force at a judge of the dead because he wants to know where Beatrice his wife is when he already delved into hell to find her in the first place is actually pretty accurate in terms of tone and intensity.  I liked a lot of the voices (Lust, Greed [Dante's father], even Lucifer), but Dante was still my favorite.-Cinematics/Cutscenes: Fantastic ... not sure what else to say about them ... yeah they are raw and uncensored, but aside from the sex appeal they just look amazing.  The cinematics are simply beautiful and made me feel like i was actually seeing what hell looked like (not that hell is beautiful or anything ...), and the animated cutscenes were dramatic and strongly supported the narrative while adding underlying meaning in almost every second with picture distortion and alteration.  And bonus points for being able to watch any of these vids after you've seen them once in the Extras section!-Soundtrack: Epicly appropriate.-Controls/Combat: You have a very basic arsenal at the start of the game.  And while it DOES expand, it doesn't get to the point of being unmanageable.  Even with a maxed out holy and unholy tree you can still easily access any combination or attack you want with relative ease.  I'm not saying it's gets boring; however, i did find myself at one point just trying to decide which combination of moves i should put together to make the kill look even cooler lol. Also liked the simple finishers ... hit X or B to punish or absolve (respectively) a foe and then watch a cool finisher.  The quicktime events were few and far between (this is a PRO by the way lol), albeit they DID sometimes show up at inopportune times when i wasn't ready for them and that meant i had to try again >_&lt;.  All in all the combat is smooth and streamlined and you can flow from scythe attacks to cross moves and back again with relative ease.--CONS---Controls/Environment: Mostly minor issues. Anywhere from moving easily on the rapelling ropes to climbing the \"walls of the damned\". Also for every 1 death i had at the hands of an enemy monster i would have 20 to the environment ... not saying i did, this is just what i feel is an accurate ratio.  Anywhere from touchy jump controls from moving platform to moving platform, to the fact that any environmental hazard that DIDN'T kill you instantly would rip off half of your life bar and spit it back in your face like it just laughed at you and made you wish the dang fire had just killed you off completely because if you go into the next big fight with the health it left you with you're going to die anyway >_&lt;.  Overall the issues as i said are minor and easily ignored in the larger scale of the game's awesomeness.-Morale/leveling system: Not enough of it.  Would have really loved if it was more than 7 levels of both holy and unholy skills and abilities. Granted it still takes 2 playthroughs just to max out both, but more would be better lol.--Closing comment--Loved the game.  Played it through 2 and 1/2 times.  It's a solid 5-7 hours of gameplay depending on the difficulty. If you don't like going \"WTF?!?\" every few minutes on your first playthrough then this game is not for you lol. ......... just watch out for the uncircumsized babies ..... they're gonna geeeeet you! lol", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Breasts, babies and bloody beast butchery.", "unixReviewTime": 1276300800, "reviewTime": "06 12, 2010"}

Just to recap what I did to make this gun outstanding:  First off, the fact that it was necessary to remove the wrist strap was annoying, so right at the back of the channel where the wiimote fits in, I drilled a 1/2\" hole in the side of the gun so that I could just feed the strap through there. Nyko should have thought of this.  Second of all, I found that my hand was extremely tired very quickly while using this with HOTD: Overkill, and I quickly realized it was due to the gun being so front heavy, requiring me to put a deathgrip on the handle. This was easily remedied by opening up the handle by pulling off the blue cover on the one side, and then sliding some stacks of pennies wrapped in electrical tape in the handle to weigh it down.  This balances the gun perfectly and relaxes my hand a bit while playing. Overall, once I made these mods, it is a 5 star gun, but because i had to do them myself (although very simple) it is only deserving of 4 stars now.

You take on the role of Red, whose family was murdered in front of him when he was young.  In addition to Red, you also play as some of the other characters including Red's friends and even the bad guy himself.  The look and sound of the game is based on Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns starring the likes of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, which are among my favorite films of all-time.  The style of the game stays true to the genre with the look, feel, and sounds.  It's a blast to play with quick-drawing, rapid-firing, sharp-shooting action.  The settings also look spectacular which includes everything from border towns, cemetaries and silver mines to rivers, mountains and green, green valleys.  Gameplay ranges from run and shoot to stagecoach and train chases on horseback.  The controls are a bit odd but you are taken through tutorial early in the story to help you master the art of the quick-draw and the dead-eye!  Some of the voices and the dialogue are a bit silly but it adds to the charm of the game and are good for a chuckle here and there.  There is also a Showdown mode where you can take one opponent to earn extra cash and unlockable items.  It's also a good place to practice your aiming technique.

Eden did this incredibly well with Test Drive Unlimited. I suggest you buy that game instead.Cons:- EVERYTHING ELSE- the camera/view/perspective is insane and simply uncontrollable. This game has a 1st person/3rd person/3rd person (forced) perspective. It switches back and forth between these perspectives every 5 seconds against your will (you have no choice), disorienting you, and when the perspective changes the control layout also changes which is even further disorienting. This means that if you are looking around in 1st person (with right thumbstick - like every other game in the world) and the game sudden changes to 3rd person (because they think it's a neat cinematic gimmick), that right thumbstick no longer functions as it did before. In combat, it gets worse. that same thumbstick changes yet again depending on the weapon. Wow, that, is, nuts.- first person view is too slow- controls are insane and uncontrollable. As described above, they keep changing and you have to unlearn everything you just learned and relearn what the h*ll everything does based on what perspective you are in and what the situation is. That's the problem. Your brain will still be using the layout you were able to use 2 seconds ago, because that's natural, intuitive and the way most good games work. h*ll, even really bad games have consistent controls.- there is NO option for the gamer to map the controller as in other games. If they'd put the controls in the gamer's hands, maybe this would have been a 2 or a 3.- even if you master the constantly changing controls, they are still slow, clunky and unresponsive. Doing things like jumping and just trying to pick something up can be goofy.- While the inventory system is interesting and has a professional looking interface, it functions like everything else in this game, with poor unintuitive controls. Beyond that, the inventory doesn't pause the action, so you'll get your butt kicked in combat trying to figure out what to do with the inventory...nice- the use \"fire to kill everything\" gimmick is overused and seems a bit silly. Fire isn't ubiquitous in real life.- dialog not really inspired- story not really engaging- don't really care about the characters- driving is horrid. I won't even talk about it.- combat is tedious, long, difficult and silly using the clunky controls. and again, UNINTUITIVE and utterly inconsistent.- All of the above means POOR GAME TESTING. Somebody, somewhere at some point must have mentioned the camera and controls. My guess is that somebody did, they weren't the boss, and the boss never played the game.Usually with bad games, you have things like bad AI which runs right at you, low-rez textures, bugs, poor collision detection, stuff like that. These are hallmarks of low budgets, rushed titles, noob programmers, etc...Alone in the Dark is very bad is UNUSUAL ways. Like they had a big budget, decent developers, and had good tools in their hands, but still managed to create a monstrosity. That crazy show \"Cop Rock\" comes to mind.

It is identical to MW2.  They changed some of the kill streaks and death streaks and how items are unlocked but it is the same game.  This should have just been an expansion pack.  The maps are small, confining, suffocating, and almost linear with people just camping around every corner even if your playing an objective based game-type like domination.  It's just not a whole lot of fun.The spec-ops Survival is entertaining for a short while.  The spec-ops missions are a huge step backwards.  Most of them are \"clear the hallway\" missions.  Your basically both running down a hallway or corridor shooting enemies that pop out in front of you to escape or diffuse a bomb.  I enjoyed the MW2 spec-ops missions much more.

I did play through the original Half Life, and its difficulty (especially in the later stages) was a bit of a turn-off. Personally, I think that when the game practically necessitates cheating to complete it, it's a bit too much. That said, seeing this bundle on the store shelf was a bit too good of a deal to pass up, so I picked it up.First impressions on the game design- the physics is more heavily involved in gameplay than in any other shooter before or since. In fact, in many cases the gameplay seems to FOCUS on the physics, not on killing enemies. To underscore this, you can actually finish most of the game with only the gravity gun, which (except in rare cases) can't kill anything directly but can pick up objects to throw at enemies. This is an interesting departure from the norm, but there are times when I think they took it a bit too far. Typically, you'll start off killing enemies and will have the normal frantic bursts of action, but you'll eventually run into a puzzle. These are usually something as simple as a locked door or elevator, and you simply (or not) have to open it or turn it on. Most of the puzzles can be figured out given a reasonable amount of effort on the player's part, but there are a few that will undoubtedly frustrate to the point where you simply look it up. I guess this is fine, so long as you aren't highly averse to cheating in such a fashion. I will say, when you do get where you're going, you do feel a sense of accomplishment at having figured it out.The game's graphics are pretty good even for now, and voice acting is well done. The environments are well made and look realistic in a sort of grim alien/post-apocalyptic style. It's nothing that will blow you away after seeing next-gen titles, but it's none too shabby either. Additionally, the episodes feature graphic improvements. If you have bought a machine anytime in the last 3-4 years, chances are it'll run smoothly at max settings. The game is quite stable as well, though it doesn't seem to like being minimized. One thing to note is that the game does take quite a while to start up and has occasional- and sometimes rather jarring- load pauses. These usually take place in a featureless corridor, and I found that after a while I could tell when it was about to stop to load.The original HL2 is generally a good story and great pace, save for one glaring thing. There are two sequences where you're driving a vehicle around, and it's my opinion (and most I've mentioned it to agree) that these are just WAY too long. It's almost as if the developers were justifying the time they spent making the vehicles work by stretching out these sequences to a ridiculous length. Some other interesting notes are that allies are somewhat useful now, and the variety of enemies is enough that they don't get overly repetitive. Particularly, there is a point where you get to command an endless horde of weak critters to overwhelm a horde of enemies (fortunately, not endless), which is one of the highlights of the game.The episodes (1 and 2) more or less follow the same style of the original. You lose all your weapons at the start of each one, which is rather irritating, and they aren't especially long installments. They largely serve to drive the plot along, which is actually getting interesting enough that I'm looking forward to the finale. You spend most of your time with Alyx backing you up, which is good if you hate being lonely, but somewhat of a shift in gears from the core game where you're largely solo. There are a few surprises and new enemies along the way, and enough new environments to make things fun.Additionally, this package comes with Team Fortress and Portal, which are a multiplay shooter and puzzle game respectively. I haven't looked into either extensively since I largely bought this pack to get the Half Life content, but it's a nice bonus.The only big gripe I have about the Orange Box is something that a lot of other people have complained about- specifically, Steam and the Valve DRM. If you don't have a live internet connection you CANNOT play any of the games since it needs to connect to Steam to authenticate you. Steam also performs updates whenever you launch, so patching is not optional and can eat into your game time when you don't particularly want it to. There were times when I was playing some online game, my internet died, and I figured to just play some HL2 instead... and after a few minutes sitting on the 'Now loading...' prompt I remembered it wasn't going to work either. This, like many other aspects of Half Life 2, is different from any other shooter out there- but not in a pleasant way. Personally, I don't see why it can't authenticate once in 3 launches, or even every other launch. Even that would be preferable to the way it is now.All in all, the Orange Box is a great value if you haven't already bought HL2 or Episode 1. I'd hesitate to say it's a 'great' value for Episode 2 alone, but this is also available separately on Steam if you already have the rest. For those who haven't tried the core game, it's a lot of fun and good game time for the price, and unlike most new shooter releases you probably won't have to upgrade your PC to run it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great package for those who are new to HL2", "unixReviewTime": 1196726400, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2007"}

Improvements to areas such as contact between players and affects on shots, fast breaks, player differentiation particularly in the area of speed, and better passing including manual bounce passes are all worth noting. The addition of \"Signature Skills\" helps to better differentiate individuals beyond just their ratings adding another layer of strategy.The biggest change comes with dribbling moves shifting to the right analog stick. The system is a vast improvement over \"Isomotion\" of the past. It does take some time to get accustomed to and become natural to utilize but the array of moves at a player's disposal is impressive. NBA 2K13 still wouldn't be described as especially accessible to new or inexperienced gamers but the ability to learn and practice in the Training Camp feature is helpful. It just takes time to translate into game situations.Kinect voice command integration, as with other titles that it has debuted in recently, is hit or miss. It's nice to have the option to call out substitutions or make play calls on the fly without having to look down at the controller but whether it actually is less of a nuisance to do so in such a manner is harder to quantify. In a few instances Kinect called timeouts without being prompted to do so...apparently picking up on something the commentary team said.The one area that arguably needs the most attention going forward is rebounding which has proven to be inconsistent and at times frustrating. Other aspects such as not catching passes in stride, catch and shoot responsiveness, and boundary recognition are also identifiable as areas to improve upon. An occasionally disappearing scoreboard (that doesn't return) has been especially troublesome and a patch to fix that should be expected. Despite there always being room for improvement, with all that is right, there is very little reason to complain about the gameplay experience.*MyCareer ModeLast year NBA 2K12's MyPlayer, which is now known as MyCareer, fell into the 'Misses' section of the review. With 2K13 however a number of problems that seriously grinded on the experience have been addressed while the feature set has continued to expand.Teammate AI has been vastly improved along with the CPU's handling of the rosters. MyPlayers start with better ratings and can even go as high as first in the draft...keeping in mind that whatever player was originally selected in that spot in the draft will also be on that team.There are still some issues like the CPU not running plays or being unable to see the art on the court anyway, freezes (one already corrected on the 360 but others have been hit too), any passes being deemed \"bad\" that lead to assists not counting, a still at times frustrating on-court grading system, and poor looking representations of players that is screaming for something along the lines of EA's Game Face feature. For the most part though these things are no where near the severity of what had been wrong in the mode in past iterations.MyCareer continues to offer an admirable cultural experience that comes with off-the-court features. Though things like interviews and GM discussions are stiff and awkward having a style section, contracts that matter (\"VC\"), a number of endorsements, and the new Twitter feature which includes relevant commentary on events from journalists or \"celebrities\", really enhances the emotional attachment to progression through a career. The ability to add \"Signature Skills\" also takes things beyond just numbers for ratings and adds more personality. All-Star Weekend content is also integrated meaning the potential of participating in the Dunk Contest or 3PT Shootout is there, though limited only to those who pre-ordered the game.*Presentation and CommentaryOne of the significant influences to NBA 2K13 comes from Jay-Z's involvement. As executive producer he had input on areas such as the soundtrack, look of the menus, and even some of the game presentation elements. Some will like these touches while other's won't care for them but ultimately they don't really do any harm regardless. At the very least it's different.Commentary is once again excellent and oftentimes provides interesting information or even laughs. Clearly a lot of new audio was recorded and the flow and relevance of it is excellent. A few celebrities can be spotted courtside which is a neat thing to see. The broadcast presentation remains top notch. The graphics this year take a slight step back and the colors are still off for some teams. Loading times are brief and menu responsiveness is crisp.*Online PlayFinally online play is not a huge drag on the NBA 2K series. Neglecting such a huge element of the game over the years - and making excuses like being stuck with Dreamcast servers and code - was unacceptable particularly considering it's increased cultural stature. Online makes an unexpected appearance then in the 'Hits' section despite not being stellar. It's just so improved that it needs to be noted.Instances of lag and disconnects have been limited and connections into games have been much quicker. Considering the initial tracking of online performance was done in release week, which is typically when game's struggle under the pressure of high usage, it was especially encouraging. Games have been smooth and consistent making them exceedingly fun to play.The feature set online is still lacking however. MyPlayer Blacktop is a decent addition but one that isn't terribly compelling and can be boring when playing with random people. Crew mode, a favorite of a vocal contingent, didn't return this year. Even pauses by opponents during games still leave a user sitting around and unable to do anything but wait. Check out the full detailed online impressions here.*Historic and Olympic Teams2K Sports may be phasing out the presence of classic teams and players within NBA 2K but the impressive roster of those available is still worth considering. There is no central mode for them to be used in, and the Dream Team and 2012 Olympic team fall into that same boat, and that is somewhat disappointing. Allen Iverson was the big addition allowing for the 2001 76ers to be the only new historic team for 2K13. A few key names are also missing from various teams while Charles Barkley is only found on the Dream Team. Though there is no real centerpiece for any of these teams, including the complete Dream Team which is great to have, the depth and value of them is still there.With the company minimizing their place in the game, from the cover and marketing to their usefulness within, it's reasonable to expect that this may be the last year that they are a big part of the product or involved at all. Many of the players, including Michael Jordan, were believed to be locked in with three year contracts that would expire after 2K13. The big names of the past and their respective teams helped take the 2K series to a level that many never believed possible. With no competition and the level of regard the game is held at now they may be deemed unnecessary or cost-prohibitive going forward.*All-Star ContentAs far as the Dunk Contest goes 2K received some criticism for adapting a \"Guitar Hero\" concept. Is it far more simplified than past implementations? Yes...but that doesn't mean it's necessarily easy at the same time. The higher difficulty dunks will take a lot of practice and even a bit of luck to pull off. Because of the the action slowing dramatically in order to allow for the process to be completed there isn't a great rhythm to the contest but there is still a sense of satisfaction to completing each dunk and watching some crazy ones play out. The commentary during the All-Star Weekend events is also particularly great.The Three Point Contest is unquestionably the weakest event. There is a distinct lack of responsiveness - though that is somewhat alleviated beginning the shooting process immediately after releasing each shot and manually advancing to the next rack. It still doesn't provide a sense of proper rhythm. The All-Star Game and Rising Stars Challenge are just what one would expect of them. Their integration within MyCareer and Association is where they offer the most value. As of now there is no way to obtain the All-Star Weekend content for those who did not preorder the game.Undesignated*MyTeam ModeThe clone of Ultimate Team from various EA Sports titles, MyTeam, deserves at least some discussion for what it offers but didn't fit well in either the positive or the negative column. Someone like myself who currently doesn't have an emotional investment with one particular team can find a constantly changing and improving roster of players especially compelling. There are plenty of people out there who simply like the team-building aspect regardless. There's a reason why Ultimate Team makes EA hundreds of millions each year and many are shelling out cash now in MyTeam. It's a fun and compelling concept when executed well.The biggest problem with MyTeam however is super-teams have been formed killing the enjoyment of the process for those that want to earn their way through which is what the mode should be designed to reward with a sense of achievement. The matchmaking does no favors by placing teams compiled of backups against those that are stacked say eight deep with All-Stars and legends. Given that this is essentially an online mode - playing offline can earn \"VC\" to spend but has no point otherwise and there is no way to just play exhibition games against friends online - it's a big problem. It is not at all practical to invest the number of hours required to be able to compete with those who are paying their way to star-studded lineups.Aspects such as applying signature skills - which can make the same player perform differently than he would on other teams without that skill or with different skills - and a fluctuating market value of players throughout the season are interesting twists on the mode. Unfortunately there isn't any real incentive to not just buy the best players out there as lower rated ones really aren't all that much cheaper anyway. MyTeam will be fun for those who invest money in it while others who choose not to shell out cash will get quickly discouraged and move on to something else.Negatives*Association/Online AssociationAssociation mode in the NBA 2K series remains one of the better franchise modes out there but a lack of advancement, not just this year but now for several iterations, shouldn't be overlooked as a refresh of some sort is needed. This year Association took a backseat in favor of MyTeam mode. Even the All-Star content being integrated within Association was held back as a preorder incentive. The inability to turn off auto-saves has also frustrated some and no credit in the way of \"VC\" is provided for games completed.Online Association was not ready to be released in 2K12, and while a number of much needed admin controls have been added for 2K13, failing to address concerns like single anonymous vetoes scrapping trades and a number of other confusing elements make the mode a struggle to sustain long term. There is also now a stamina bug that causes players to be drained of energy only minutes into games. A website to tie into 2K13's Online Association has not launched.*Virtual CurrencyThroughout NBA 2K13 is the new economic system that is intended to reward time spent playing 2K13. Unfortunately it is the biggest detractor of enjoyment at the same time. \"VC\" penalizes those who want to play 2K13 organically and in turn dissuades more than it incentivizes.2K Sports has failed to communicate precisely enough how the \"VC\" system works - where it is earned and how much for doing what - and that confusion will play into frustration. Ultimately the currency system is the driving force behind progression in MyCareer mode and team building in MyTeam mode. In MyCareer it can be spent on improving attributes, adding skills, or fashion while MyTeam requires it to purchase players or boosters and maintain the roster.The prices are out of whack however with their true value. There is no reason to spend on expensive clothing or accessories when its better put to use on actually improving a player's attributes or skills. In MyTeam, even on day one, there were super-teams already ruining the experience for people who did not want to pull out their wallet to buy their own and compete. Getting quit on in an online game also means losing some VC earnings and payouts seem to be higher for one-off exhibition or blacktop games than those actually completed in MyPlayer. There is a huge imbalance in how many hours need to be invested to earn the amount of VC, upwards of 20 hours, to get a single All-Star for MyTeam when one could just be bought outright for $6. It just ends up making more sense to pay if that is the goal being worked towards.The way things are set up with \"VC\" is to encourage the purchase of it rather than properly earning it. It even can discourage someone from playing the game the way they want to play it as they'll be forced to choose between spending \"VC\" in one mode or the other - or split it which will mean slower rate of improvement in both.NBA 2K13 is the best all-around basketball video game to date. Where NBA 2K11 delivered a once-in-a-generation type experience that helped to cover up its deficiencies, and NBA 2K12 struggled to do so nearly as well with the lockout having a big impact on early enjoyment, 2K13 is well-rounded and avoids many issues that have plagued the series in the past. Even MyTeam will be fun for some people as will Association mode despite the lack of additions or advancements. Only the \"VC\" system really deserves negative scrutiny.With online play that at least works fairly consistently now, a deep and involving career mode, excellent gameplay and presentation, and the large selection of historic teams plus the Olympic squads, NBA 2K13 has become arguably the best value in all of sports gaming. It's a return to greatness that proves the NBA 2K series has earned its increased stature and not let up in the face of unchallenged success.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The most well-rounded NBA 2K title yet.", "unixReviewTime": 1350259200, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2012"}

Bioware (the game developer for both) struck gold with their epic, morally charged RPG's, and when it was announced that Bioware would be releasing another game in the same vein on the Xbox 360 (Mass Effect), fans went rabid.  Two years before its official release Bioware hyped up Mass Effect in various magazine interviews, and soon demos were released showing off the graphics and gameplay.As with every A-list video game, Mass Effect was going to be THE next generation video game experience. Bioware boasted a massive universe; one that featured many planets available for exploration, an extensive and unique conversation system, and their usual good/bad choices. They also boasted a squad-based combat where you could control your AI team mates. Bioware also promised a slew of side quests and missions, which included a vast array of uncharted worlds to explore.Now, I have come to accept the sad fact that most of what a developer promises will never see the light of day, but in the case of Mass Effect it seems that some things were literally cut short without any reparation or reason.Before I get into my review, I would like to state that Mass Effect is a really fun and engrossing RPG that offers a really fun conversation system, a fully realized universe, an awesome story-line, and real-time combat a la Gears of War. Mass Effect offers a character creation system that allows you to customize your character and level-up him or her as you see fit, not to mention you get to choose from a handful of job classes (Infiltrator, Soldier, etc..)The graphics of Mass Effect are true Next Generation splendor. Everything we have come to expect of modern video game graphics is present, from realistic and lifelike character models to fully rendered and detailed backgrounds and items. In the graphics department, Mass Effect truly exceeds and surpasses most games. Optional grain filters and blurring effects are available as well.However, due to marketing schemes by Microsoft, the game is marred rather frequently by long load times, texture pop ins and the occasional jitters. What is this marketing scheme I speak of? The core Xbox 360 system that does not feature a hard drive.The soundtrack is very atmospheric and reminiscent of old school Science Fiction movies, and it does a great job of immersion. You will feel like you are in some strange science fiction movie. Sound Effects are pretty good as well. No complaints here...The control is very similar to KOTOR and Jade empire, except that Mass Effect has real-time combat instead of Turn based. Similar to Gears of War, there is a cover system, thought it is often very clunky and unnatural feeling, and you will probably spend more time just standing behind cover than hiding behind it. Weapons follow your standard shooter fare - pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles and shotguns. There are some grenades and such as well. The really draw however, is the biotic and tech powers; the meat and potatoes of the combat. Each character (your team mates included) have a range of biotic powers (Mass Effect's version of magic) available to them, and they all kick butt. Depending on what character you create and how you level-up that character, various biotic powers will be made available. Tech powers work in the exact same fashion.Mass Effect also offers a quick menu that pauses the combat, allowing you to use your team mates tech and biotic powers, as well as change their weapons. This is a handy feature as there are more than enough intense battles where you will find yourself outnumbered and out-gunned.The biggest feature of Mass Effect has to be its story-line and extensive background information. Through various \"codex\" entries, through conversations and surveying planets, you will learn the history of the Mass Effect Universe. The story line is perfectly intertwined with the history, and succeeds in being a deeply engrossing and involved story with a pretty interesting plot.The conversation system is truly unique in that it allows for perfectly seamless conversations that feel like cinematic cut scenes, or at least that is how it would feel if Bioware had put more time into it. While the conversations do have a somewhat interesting and engrossing quality to them, the characters facial and body movements are very repetitive and boring, and the conversation scenes hardly serve as the games cut-scenes (as Bioware claimed they would). They basically consist of a still scene showing your party and whoever you are talking to, with the occasional close up of a characters face or body movement. YAWN...Since a good chunk of Xbox 360 owners own the core version that has no hard-drive, all developers must create their game to run off of the game disc only; this leads to problems galore. Mass Effect is a HUGE game, and Xbox 360 discs are relatively small - do you see where I'm going with this? My guess is that in order for everything to fit on the game disc, and to keep the disc number down to 1 Bioware was forced to cut things out. This is evident in the \"explorable\" universe. The limitless universe that Bioware bragged and hyped about during development is NO WHERE to be seen. Sure, there are still various planet systems to travel to, and they all host about 6 planets, but you cannot actually \"land\" on all of them. In fact, the player will spend more time \"surveying\" (which involves pushing a button and reading the text that pops up) the planet or even reading a wall of text associated with the history of the planet rather than actually exploring them. There are only a handful of planets that the player can actually land on, and these explorable planets comprise a good majority of the side-quests.On these planets, the player controls a vehicle (called the Mako), sort of like a dune buggy, and can explore a very limited portion of the planet (which usually is a big square area surrounded by an invisible wall). Not only is the Mako incredibly annoying to control, there is literally NOTHING to do on these planets. Besides the occasional enemy outpost, the ability to mine for minerals (a push of a button), and a confounded sense of \"WTF?\" these \"uncharted\" planets offer little in terms of side-missions.Not only is there nothing to do on these planets, but their design is exactly the same. Every uncharted planet has the same looking sky (though  the color may change from planet to planet), and they all boast the same boring mountainous regions and rocky terrain. Seriously, this very lazy on the part of Bioware, though I feel that the poor design of these planets has more to do with time constraints than sloppy developing.Another big issue is the moral dilemmas that your character faces during the game. Instead of aligning with a \"good\" side or an \"evil\" side, the player can either align themselves with the Paragon side of the Renegade side. Essentially, the character cannot join an \"evil\" side, or even play a \"bad\" character, the choices boil down to this - what would you do to save the universe? Will you slaughter mercilessly for the sake of the entire universe, or will you play by the book? Don't get me wrong, this is a really neat concept, and if Bioware had more time I'm sure they would have perfected it.My biggest gripe with this Paragon/Renegade dynamic is that, either way you choose, you save the universe; the Paragon (good)/Renegade (bad) conversation choices and decisions really only serve as replay value, and only a few of these choices alter the course of the game.What's worse, is that your team mates don't really even question your authority if you do something horrible (like murder innocents); in fact, your team mates don't even really feel \"alive\". The only time you really get to know your team mates is on your space ship (The Normandy), where the romance plot lines and such take place. Other than that, there is little to no conversational exchange between your character and your team mates on missions. Not only does this break the engrossing quality of the Mass Effect world, but it makes for some very boring game play as well. Considering KOTOR and Jade Empire both featured extensive dialogue between the characters, the lack of such feature in Mass Effect can only be chalked up to a rushed development.Another tell tale sign that this game was rushed is the fact that you can only talk to certain NPC's (usually those associated with a quest). I may be spoiled by high profile RPG's like Oblivion, but you SHOULD be able to talk to various NPC's, they should have their own lives and daily routines. I mean, we are in the Next Generation of video games, the Xbox 360 CAN support this feature. In essence, the NPC's should be interactive; another missing feature that severely breaks the engrossing factor of Mass Effect.Negatives aside, Mass Effect is a truly fun game that is worth playing, just don't expect what Bioware promised.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Wait is over.....", "unixReviewTime": 1198627200, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2007"}

Gears Of War uses Xbox 360's full potential of graphics and gameplay. Humans are fighting against an alien race called the \"Locust\".

Detailed character models, really detailed enviroments that bring the game to life. If your a fan of graphics this game will not dissapoint you at all.The sound in this game is also great, fits the theme of the game. The sound is also accompanied by members you fight with to your enemies yelling stuff back and forth throughout battles.The controls in this game are quite easy. Learning the controls shouldnt take the average gamer long at all. Some people get frusturated about the leaning and crouch up and against objects saying it isnt responsive. But it is, the controls are perfectly controlled and set during the game in my opinion. You can crouch behind/against an object while sending blind fire and peeking up every other second to fire at the enemy(A good feature the game possesses).The fun factor of this game is very high, the single player campaign is fun and keeps you interested in the story the whole time. Even though its fun, I think the storyline should have been a little more fleshed out than it actually is. The game was in the making for a long time and the story just didnt seem ALL there. But the story is good enough. Multi-Player is also a good aspect of the game. Good game types, and no flaws really that I can see in it. The choice of weapons is great also, a good variety. Boom shot, a automatic rifle with a chainsaw, shotgun, pistol, torque bow (good weapon if you get good at it).Overall, this game is REALLY good, hardly any flaws and great solid gameplay.

Lots of fun in the highly destructive levels3. Nice sound4. I myself thought the cinematic videos were very interesting. It makes me want to see more of the imperfects ( perhaps in a movie or cartoon of their own. )Cons1. Needs more characters it does have a big selection, but you those characters really don't have enough moves. If your going to give characters such a limited amount of moves you should make more characters to choose from.2. More fighting environments would have made the game better also. Even though they are destructive they could always be more destructive.3. The selection of characters they chose for the game was kind of questionable. I mean Daredevil and Elektra are cool characters and all, but in the opening cinema it shows Captain America and Incredible Hulk being taken out. I'm sure they woudl have been able to withstand the imperfects invasion easier than Daredevil and Elektra would be able to. That's just my opinion though.Overall though I really do think this game has the potential to push it above and beyond in the fighting genre of games. With some improvements in the sequel if and I hope they do make a sequel then this game would be one heck of a game.If you want a fast action paced game. Then this game is for you.

There are a few suits that you are only able to find after playing through the game on subsequent playthroughs on a new game + mode, and there are others that you get from clearing the game on a specific difficulty setting. In a new game + mode your inventory is carried over from your last save point into your new game. This is a nice feature because it adds replay value to the game, and it's just fun to have access to your favorite weapons early on that you're not supposed to get until later in the game.This game looks a little darker to me than the first one. I never had any problems seeing things in the first one, but in this game I had to adjust the settings on my TV along with the in game brightness, until I found something that worked nicely.I tried the online multiplayer once, and it was fun to get the chance to play as a Necromorph. It's a nice addition, but I'm more interested in the single player mode, which is loads of fun. If you love a good challenge then there's also Zealot mode and Hardcore mode available. In hardcore mode you're limited to only 3 save points, and you're given NO checkpoints, so when you die you'll be starting from your last save again. In Zealot you can save as much as you want and you have checkpoints again, but the enemies do the most damage to you in this mode, and you do the least amount of damage to them.

If you're a fan of the Zelda series, this game is simply not to be missed. If you're just getting into the battle (and believe me, it is a battle with the oft-frustrating motion controls), keep reading to find out if it's for you.STORYThe story is standard. Zelda and Link, who happen to be childhood friends this time around, are two teenagers chosen to carry out the will of a goddess and protect the world from evil forces. I feel like I've played this plot a thousand times over, but that's acceptable considering it sets the scene for an epic adventure. You'll journey from Skyloft, a floating island above the clouds where inhabitants ride giant birds and believe that they are the only beings in the universe, to three main areas on \"earth.\" No one in their right mind can call the story deep, though who's going to complain when having a good time?GAMEPLAY/CONTROLSI'll keep this simple. MOTION CONTROLS ARE FUN, BUT OFTEN FRUSTRATING OR GIMMICKY. Do I really need to thrust my sword in the ground with a motion that could have been achieved with one click? That's a gimmick. However, mapping the motion of your controller to your in-game sword while in battle is awesome. Oh yes, it can be annoying to actually hit some of the creatures that follow your sword and block accordingly when you have to switch position fast but the console doesn't completely register your motion... Still, the limits of the motion control technology aren't gamebreaking, and this is the only game I know of that does it well the majority of the time. NAVI IS BACK, BUT THIS TIME SHE'S ON ANTI-DEPRESSANTS. So, for those who don't get the reference... There's a spirit that lives in your sword and she gives you hints when you request them. That part's fine. But this spirit has zero personality and alerts you with beeping noises when your controller batteries are drained and when your life is low. Seriously? I can keep track of those things myself. And the steady beeping sound when your life is low, the one that's independent from the spirit alert, is extremely obnoxious. THERE WILL BE BACKTRACKING. I can't stand going through the same area multiple times doing similar things each time. Be prepared for that annoyance mid-game. YOUR MAIN CHARACTER IS A MUTE WHO'S ALSO LACKING IN THE PERSONALITY DEPARTMENT. Link, the main character, never talks in the game. Everyone else has speech bubbles (there's no voice-acting), yet you never know what Link is saying. Ok, sometimes you get speech options, but they don't affect gameplay, so what's the point?Despite these downsides, the game is epic, swordplay is exciting, auxiliary items are fun to use (especially the bow), and the game offers so much to do and explore that it's still a five-star game in my eyes. Expect 40 to 60 hours of gameplay, with many hours devoted to sidequests and exploration.GRAPHICSIs this really what you buy a Wii game for? The game is colorful, but the graphics are not to be lauded, even for the Wii. Link looks odd, and cartoony is not the right word... It's like the designers tried to make him somewhat realistic-looking but failed. Edges are sometimes choppy... I will say the game runs like a well-oiled machine.

I only point that out because you'll have a bunch of the \"I LOVE all Battlefield game\" type reviews and although it's cool to love the game, it doesn't give the rest of us a realistic picture of the game.I will keep it simple...Pros - The frost bite engine obviously; that is the platform used to create this game. You can literally blow up everything in the game. I love how you can just take apart a building if someone is hiding inside. You can also spawn with your team which is nice since the maps are so expansive. There also seems to be a fair number of maps available with enough depth to keep me interested. The single player campaign is decent, but lets face it, most FPS games are really all about the online action these days. And lastly, VEHICLES! Tanks, jet skis, 4-runners, helicopters, etc. AWESOME!!!!!! I would also say the graphics are pretty solid. I've also heard there are a lot of weapons options but since I am only a level 2 I have yet to really experience anything beyond my XMB assault rifle.Cons - If you think you're going to get online with 7 or 8 friends and jump into a match against some guys, FORGET IT! Major failing in this game is the fact the online multi-player only has 4 person squads. I imagine this is because they want to keep with the 4-person squad behind the BF story. But who cares? Let me invite more than 3 other friends to play. AND, you will often have your group split up when attempting to join a game. That is terrible in my opinion and the primary reason I will most likely not spend a ton of time playing this otherwise good game.

GRAPHICS (let me emphasize) and gameplay have progressed drastically. The picture in this game is stunning, definitely blowing the roof off of it's previous installments and setting a new standard for FF RPGs, much like FF7 did when it came out.The thing about 7, however, was it's stunning story. Complex, engrossing, shocking.  FF13 does NOT deliver a mind blowing story. Although the story is very strong and complex with no loose strings.  It is not as great as 7 and 10 in story.  Characters were even a little bit forgettable in my opinion, as I can't really even remember every character after beating it 6 months ago.Gameplay is the other thing that has improved.  FF12 had a new faster battle system, making it like an action RPG, 13 is better evolved and went back to the old school decisive battles, just as it should. One thing I really liked was customizing different types of roles and formations, which were a little confusing at first but very useful. Still can't say gameplay is the best as I have enjoyed that of 7 and 10 even more as well, but it is creative and not boring, and very good overall.One thing you might like, or find annoying, is the CHALLENGE (underline, highlight) of this game.  It takes enough time to beat this game, but if your a perfectionist like me, this game is your worst nightmare.  Subquest after subquest, perfect score subquests, and not to mention ultimate weapons which are next to impossible in obtaining for everyone unless you have plenty of time on your hands.  I think most would find this a good quality, but trust me, I even gave up before getting any ultimate weapons or getting halfway through subquests and I spent A LOT of time on this game.Bottom line, if your a hardcore RPG fan or even just playing an FF game for the first time, I'll say go for it, it's a great game, with the best graphics out there.

When talking to friends about the game, I have frequently mentioned how cool it would be to have a Sims game that takes you away from the standard \"doll house\" suburbia scenario.  I mean, how hard would it be to make a medieval Sims, you know?So enter Castaway Stories.  The concept has so much potential.  No longer does your sim just exist in a house and have a job.  Now he/she must survive.  From climbing up banana trees to spear fishing to having a pet monkey, Castaway seemingly starts out as that breath of fresh air so desperately needed in the series.  This game is completely unique from all the other expansions AND \"stories.\"  New interactions, new goals, new game focus.This was my initial impression as I played through the preset Castaway \"story.\"  And I have to admit, it sucked me in.  Then I completed the story thinking \"at last, now I can really have some fun in this new environment.\"  Sadly, this was not to be the case.  This game is riddled with bugs.  It's like the developers never envisioned the players using the free play option.  As soon as I started to do normal interactions like hiring a maid or having children, the game became glitchy and sluggish.  My guess is that the game engine was not designed to handle more than the preset number of sims.This guess was further supported by evidence when I went into full neighborhood view.  For both the free play and story neighborhoods, you cannot add lots.  As in, you can't put down extra houses, you can't put down any empty lots, you can't add extra commercial lots and you can't edit the currently existing commercial lots.  Ummm... what? I could sort of understand the no editing commercial lots (it would interfere with the story), but no extra houses?!?  Needless to say, this led to a very frustrating, limiting, and shallow game play.  Add to it the ever increasing amount of bugs that continued to pop up as I tried to expand and build.So... yes.  That's pretty much the sad and depressing tale of Castaway Stories.  I should note that my experiences were based on laptop play.  I have not yet tried to install the game and play it on my desktop.

The switches, buttons and controls seem to be of high quality.  I expect it will last longer than the standard plastic guitar controllers.

They are smaller and farther apart.\"\"I like it!  It feels like I'm playing a real guitar.\"\"The buttons are too far apart.  It's harder to play fast.\"Other than when I prompted for an opinion, it otherwise does not seem like they were either overly impressed or disappointed.

So I guess the 'wow' factor of the controller sort of wears off after a while, and it becomes just another tool to use with the game.So I guess my conclusion is that if quality is important to you, this controller will not disappoint.  If feeling like you're really performing with a band and are playing a real guitar is important, then this controller will fit the bill.  If you play Rock Band or Guitar Hero a lot, and really use/abuse your guitar controller, then this one might last longer.

I mean the resolution and texture detail is noticeably lower on X360, but the XB1 has 6-8x the resources and yet it doesn't look that much better.  It is basically the same game.  Blueprint (the team that ported it to X360) did a very good job.Performance wise, it's even more similar.  If you watch Digital Foundry's performance analysis at eurogamer, the X360 version's framerate is a bit lower overall, but I'd say it's actually more consistent.  XB1 runs at 60fps when nothing is going on, but dips to the 40s and sometimes the 30s when titans are on screen.  The X360 version runs 40-50fps for the most part, always staying above 30fps.  And for those who prefer a more consistent framerate, there's an option to lock it to 30fps, which also pretty much eliminates the screen tearing.  This option is not available on XB1.Anyone looking to buy Titanfall probably already know what it's about, so I won't talk about the game itself.  I'll just say that it's a fun game.  Revolutionary?

Sometimes, it's fun to progress through a story without spending days on a super-hard puzzle.Speaking of puzzles, some are variations on ones you find everyone, but others are pleasantly different. The \"Land of Isis\" and \"The Book of the Dead\" were particularly interesting sections. And I really enjoyed the \"finale\" sequence.Other strengths were the generally good graphics, pleasant (although not memorable) music, an excellent 'save' feature so that you never have to worry about 'dying' and re-doing huge sections, lack of gore and violence, and supplementary info on ancient Eqypt (I'll take the word of other reviewers that this info was fairly accurate).Three weaknesses:1) Very linear. You finish up one section, then move on to the next.2) Too much walking from one place to another, with no 'shortcuts.' The trek from the Noas to Paser's house took 20 clicks. I wish game developers would incorporate some kind of \"teleportation\" system (a map, a spell, etc.) to get from one place to another. Once you've gone to a location, why prove you can do it again (and again and again)?3) The main character was very 'white' for an Eqyptian, wasn't she? I'm surprised they didn't give her blue eyes.Despite these minor flaws, the game is a good one, especially for those who don't crave the most challenging experience.Give it a try.... Hope you have fun!Barbara", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting puzzles, good graphics, lots of fun", "unixReviewTime": 1132963200, "reviewTime": "11 26, 2005"}

In this review I will not speak of the other games included in this bundle but they've both received great reviews. So this bundle is a good price at the time of writing this Journey was $14.99 on PlayStation network.Journey is the perfect game to introduce somebody to gaming the object is simple you walk and fly your unknown character across an amazing landscape. I think Journey would be a great game if you want to get young child into gaming. Now some of the mechanics might be lost in a young child but the moving and jumping and flying should be relatively easy for them to pick up. In this game is basically violence free minus a few points where you might be afraid (actually I got afraid a little) but it might be a little scary for young child I was a journey to be played by any child 5 years plus.As a disabled gamer I'm very interested in the options menus to see if you can remap the buttons journey has 0% remapping your stuck with one layout. Now I did get the developer to add more buttons that you can use (showing them a video of me playing with my face and having to reach across the controller to hit the X button instead of just having fly be L1 convince them to add more buttons.) And you cannot turn off the 6 axis function even though I can move the controller freely and have to hold my face this wasn't really an issue. But just be warned this game uses 2 buttons and you can assign which controller buttons you want to do that.Another thing is the multiplayer it has multiplayer kind of? As you journey through the world you meet other players that are automatically matched as you play you don't know who they are or where they're from and you can only \"chirp\" at them by pressing a button but it's kind of cute and interesting. One cool thing when you finish the game you to see a list of the gamer tags of the players that you played with totally awesome.PRO TIP:You can tell if you're playing with an advanced player by the length of their robe when you start out you have a red robe with the yellow fringe but as you play more the yellow fringe grows longer.So I recommend this game wholeheartedly if you're only visiting Journey by it straight off the PSN network I don't like having/can't because of my disability swap disks.Thanks for reading and I hope you thoroughly enjoy your journey.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Journey is an experience worth having...

Let's leave the gameplay out of it for just a moment.A NOTE TO GAMING COMPANIES:  Take lessons from Paradox in how to write a manual.  I don't think I've ever read a manual all the way through before playing the game before I bought EU.  After EU I can't say that anymore.  Yes, maybe it's a little light on explanation, but it is RICH in history and ambience.  In my opinion, the people who are thinking about buying this game are history buffs in the first place, so writing a manual rich in historical background and atmosphere was a perfect complement to the game.**Deep breath**  All right... now about the gameplay.  I have been an RPG/Strategy/Sim player since Zork and pre-Sid Meier, and in those years I have NEVER seen a game with this much depth.  Pointing out only one aspect of it is to do injustice to the rest, but if I were to sit here and comment on everything in the game this review would be Tolstoy.So... let me just comment on the diplomacy model.  So, you want your country to be Protestant?  Waitaminit... you have an alliance with Spain and Navarre (both Catholic) that has kept your fat out of the fire for years with France.  Count them out of your group of friends.  As a matter of fact, they may just take it upon themselves to cleanse your country of the Protestant &quot;taint.&quot;  Guess you'd better make nice with France, Savoy and Venice, all of whom are allied with each other and have been waiting for the right time to strike.So, you're England and you have to deal with the &quot;Scottish problem.&quot;  Do you just go in and burn them out?  Careful... they have powerful allies who will go to war with you if you do.  In other games you had to suck it up and either let them live or bear the brunt of continued attacks from their allies.  In EU if you have a peaceful bent (and patience) you can gradually pacify Scotland with a policy of honey rather than blood.  Give them a few State Gifts, invite them to marry into the English Royal Family.  Wait a while and invite them into a military alliance with you.  Wait a little longer and make them a vassal of England.  Wait still longer and eventually you can annex them into England.  Voila!  Scotland is now fully yours (or, more accurately, a part of England) without ever firing a shot (or ruining your reputation with other countries).You see where I am going with this.  I look back and see that I've written a lot.  Friends, this is just the tip of a large iceberg.  Very large.  Titanic-sinker large.  Buy this game.  Buy a lot of Mountain Dew and Doritos.

Unlike some of the Retron models, it's compatible with most all SNES and NES games, the wired controllers are quite good, it's cheaper than many other retro consoles, and it's smaller to boot. On the other hand, it offers only ports for SNES controllers and its own, so NES controllers and accessories like the Zapper won't work (so no Duck Hunt on this thing). The Duo is very lightweight, which combined with its lack of eject buttons for either slot makes removing and inserting cartridges a bit of a chore. Some minor audio issues were observed, but these were usually no more prevalent than one would expect from an original NES or SNES.

So far the game's a big step backwards in all areas, particularly disappointing as a \"fun game to play\". I'm all for change, but with this game all of the changes are for the worse. This is a huge disappoint and slap in the balls from Infinity Ward as I skipped buying Black Ops 2 and waited specifically for Infinity Ward's Ghosts, as I am/was a huge fan.-I agree that the levels are a campers paradise with lots and lots of windows for campers to peek through. Basically the levels all suck.-In COD MW3 personally I would use Support Strikepackage and the rewards, like Stealth Bomber, were fun to unleash, watch & would actually create a few kills. With Ghosts I am constantly changing my Support rewards because they are all lame. Especially that little worthless ball above me that follows me around.-In MW3 the top Support Strikepackages (EMP/Juggernaut/Escort Airdrop) were worth working towards and rewarding to have unlike the retardedly worthless Odin Support top reward in Ghosts. The idea of giving us three awesome top Strikepackage rewards to pick through was great, now with Ghosts I don't even use the top one (and one only) because it's boring & worthless.-In Ghosts Juggernaut's do not recover their health and are killed pitifully easily. I do not even pick Juggernaut as a killstreak reward because it's now so slow and easily killed where before it was slow and powerfully intimidating.-In Ghosts there isn't as many helicoptors flying around, and I loved the chess match of Assault players bombarding the skies with helecoptors only to have me unleash and take them all down with an EMP. Hearing the screams of anger & broken controllers against the walls from apartments and bedrooms around the world. I understand that there were a lot of complaints regarding Pave Lows/Reapers/AC130/AH6 Overwatch, etc., and how powerful they were and \"ruined the game play\" but as long as there is a way to take them down and counter them, I sorely miss having them to use, and as well, defeat and challenge,These are the fun little things that are no longer in Ghosts. And last but not least, getting rid of TACTICAL INSERTION is the worst mistake this game has made. Now I am forced to run from the far ends of the map back towards the action each and every time I am killed. What a friggin' burden and knucklehead move. In conclusion the game just seems very rushed and not well thought out, especially in terms of its funness factor.I've been a big time COD fan and in constant arguments with my Battlefield friends, but It's starting to look more and more like I will be converting to BF as I just purchased BF4 & FIFA Soccer with the Amazon buy 2 get 1 free awesome deal.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not all change is good.

Cut and dry - this is a quick fix, high energy, sometimes frustrating game. Races themselves vary from 2 to 7 minutes long. Basically, you pick one of your eventual 21 trucks, pick a course, and then run a six truck race. Your objective is to score star ratings (1 thru 5) by smashing other trucks, drifting, flying through the rings, maintain as much air as you can get, aerial spinning, and dodging through trees. The result of amassing stars is to improve your finish ranking (D/C/B/A/S).You run through the Cups (Bronze, Silver, Gold, & Platinum). First you have to beat the Excite Racing with an S Ranking in all your races. Then you can unlock Super Excite. Once you get an S Ranking in all those races (including the Diamond Cup), you unlock the Mirror Level which is, well, mirror versions of all the races.Each Cup has 4-5 races tracks set in different countries. Race tracks are set in Mexico, China, Scotland, Canada, Finland, and Fiji until you unlock the eventual Diamond Cup and you go to the Nebula's Crystal Road (an amalgamation of all the setting tracks in a cosmic field). Mexico, China, and Scotland are great for star scoring, Canada and Fiji are the most fun tracks. During the races you can hit terrain changing icons, ring icons, and POW icons which make you temporarily power surged and can mow down trees and other trucks with ease (beware of rocks though). You'll learn to avoid sections of the track pathway, instead discovering the short cuts.As you progress and get trophies (determined by 5 rating star stunts), you unlock new trucks to play in the game. You start in the Excite mode and end up with 10 (?) trucks to play. Once you defeat the Excite mode, you unlock Super Excite and then can unlock another 9 trucks. During game-play, if you race a truck 10 times or get 3 S Ranks on a truck you will unlock special paint jobs for each of the 19 trucks. Should you unlock the trucks and their alternate paint jobs, you automatically unlock the 20th vehicle in the Monster Truck which has the best stats (air hang time, handling, turbo boost, and traction for drifting). Now that you have all them open, should you beat the Excite, Super Excite, and Mirror levels with an S Rank in every race, you unlock the final vehicle, the Crazy Monster Truck which is nothing more than the Monster Truck stuck in power mode (you can run over trees and other trucks with no penalty crashes). Trucks will vary in skill vs terrain and there's some trucks you will use a minimum of times and others that will be your favorite (Dominator, Firefly, Rad, Mako, Saguaro, Wolverine).In addition to the racing, you can play the extra skills games. There are three skill games: one is honing your ring jumping ability, two is testing your truck ramming ability, and third is your handling ability in which you have to drive through ever decreasing racing poles. About the only other option to the game is to race head to head with a buddy which is actually pretty darn boring.Overall, it's an addicting game and you'll lose track of time but `defeating' the game and unlocking everything causes you to lose interest. About the only thing left is to go through with the Crazy Monster Truck and beat all your times and star ratings.

You start out with being able to travel for 3 days and have little side quest opportunities to do in each country, you can edit the town of each place even when you are in a regular town/world. This one is pretty awesome, I think and I really like the fact that Amazon has these games to download.as it makes things prety easy and smooth and really quick to download and install. Highly recommend this game", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this expansion!", "unixReviewTime": 1363219200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2013"}

They all share a lack of story, and boil down to mindless monster bashing for levels and loot.However, Shadowbane was different, at least in the beginning.  At first glance, Shadowbane offers players a wealth of opportunities.  Join or create a guild, and then build a city of your own.  No longer are players forced to use computer controlled cities as rallying points.  Shadowbane allows anyone and everyone to easily create their own city.  However, this great feature is also its curse.Shadowbane is at heart a Player Killers dream.  For those who don't know, a Player Killer(PKer) is someone who spends their time searching out and killing other players, instead of monsters and NPCs.  Those grand cities that you can create, can also be destroyed by other cities and guilds.  PKers tend to group together for protection, and spend time hunting down unsuspecting individuals who only wish to be left alone to build their characters and cities in peace.Shadowbane not only allows such activity, it promotes it.  It does this by unceremoniously dumping low level characters onto the mainland(populated by the afore mentioned PKers) as soon as they reach a certain level.  New players can band together, but will still easily be crushed by one or two higher levels ones that wait outside the 3 safe cities.Having played through the beta, and a couple months worth of the release, I have seen very little of this change.  Shadowbane's concept begins as great, but ends up failing in the end as everyone resorts to mindless leveling for loot and experience.  Its purpose is slightly different from all the others though.  Instead of leveling just to be able to take on bigger and better monsters, you are leveling to take on bigger and better players.In the end, Shadowbane falls short of its goal of revolutionizing MMORPGs, and ends up where they all do after a month or two.  It sits on a shelf collecting dust, and is quickly replaced by newer versions of the same premise.  Hindsight being 20/20, I would have not wasted my time with Shadowbane, and I highly suggest you don't either.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "PKers Rejoice!

I will, however, admit that it does have its share of drawbacks, but there still isn't a racing game out there that can hold a candle to this one.To begin, the graphics absolutely rock!  For as many cars and as many tracks as there are in this game, with as customizable and unique as so many of the cars are, I'm absolutely astounded.  It's one thing for a game that has, let's say 10-20 cars, to have rockin' graphics, but when a game has put such meticulous detail into each and every of the 600+ cars, you've got to be inspired (granted it did take them forever and a day to move from the previous sequel to this one).The tracks are incredible and even include moving people.  That, in itself just blew my mind.There is the addition of the ability to manage a racing team, which, I'll admit, I have yet to try, but I just bought the game two days ago, so I'm sure I'll get to it.There's also the picture taking feature, another thing I have yet to explore.  That particular feature doesn't particularly appeal to me, but it's still a neat idea.The level of customization has, again, been increased over its predecessor, although I question how much more can really be done.  The one thing I wish they had in this regard was the ability to repaint your car, but I can live with that.And, lastly, for anyone who thought far enough ahead to save their GT3 data, you can transfer the A and B licenses, in addition to $100k to the new game.  This is definitely a bonus after having put into GT3.Addressing some gripes:First of all, no, your cars don't suffer damage, but this was intentionally left out.  In an interview with the creators/developers, the discussed how they had considered adding damage, but decided against it for a few reasons: 1-Most players (the developers and myself included) prefer not to drive damaged cars.  I'm sure most of you may disagree with this until you're blue in the face, but I'm just passing along the information.  2-Probably more importantly, although this game is supposed to be \"all about the realism\" as a driving simulator, the sheer amount of data added by including realistic damage, would certainly lead to processor lag time with the (now) limited hardware of the PS2.  And, to avoid having all damage and wrecks look exactly the same on all cars, different styles of crash damage would have to be added for each and every one of the hundreds of cars.  I would much rather have the developers focus on other, more important aspects of the game.  Nuff said.Another complaint addresses the lack of Ferraris and other exotic cars.  This issue was addressed during the development of GT2 and 3.  It's the same reason that there weren't any Fords in the game, initially.  It's all about licensing issues.  Ferrari (and I assume Lamborghini, although the Lamborghini GT appeared in the Japanese release of GT3) would not sell the license to use the cars in the game.  Why?  Because Ferrari decided to contract out and develop their own game, which fell completely flat.  If Ferrari doesn't want their cars in this game, then I say to heck with em!As for online play issues, I have yet to play the PS2 online, so that isn't of any concern to me either way.So, in conclusion to all of my ramblings, is this game perfect?  No, not quite.  If some obstinent car companies would sign on (*cough-Ferrari-cough*) and, maybe, throw in a few more American cars (there are probably 2 or 3 to one as many Japanese cars as American) I would think that it was pretty darn close.  I would give this game 4.5 stars if I could, but I'll go with 5 since there seem to be so many nay-sayers.  It's simple, really: if you liked the previous installations of this game, you will like this one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still, by far, the best racing game out there!", "unixReviewTime": 1109203200, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2005"}
